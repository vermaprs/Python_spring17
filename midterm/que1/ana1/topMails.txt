I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this is a hoax:

http://urbanlegends.about.com/culture/urbanlegends/library/blemtax2.htm

Here's an excerpt from the U.S. Postal Service's published response:

A completely false rumor concerning the U.S. Postal Service is being
circulated over the Internet via e-mail.
The e-mail message claims that a "Congressman Schnell" has introduced "Bill
602P" to allow the federal government to impose a 5-cent surcharge on each
e-mail message delivered over the Internet. The money would be collected by
Internet Service Providers and then turned over to the Postal Service.

No such proposed legislation exists. In fact, no "Congressman Schnell"
exists.

Great--and I will be inspired with my draft of his remarks.

Rosie, could you call the phone number on the invitation, ask for Herb 
Bateman (he is the director), and tell him of the commitment?

I am out of town and do not have their number, and they called me wondering 
about Ken's decision last Friday.

Thanks,

Subject: Gathering Place Speaking Invitation

If you are inclined to accept this invitation, we could put together an 
interesting talk on the importance of good mental health to business with 
some national statistics and then segue into Enron's emphasis on wellness and 
having fun in the workplace.  Our strategy and experience will be very 
interesting to the group since it shows what a corporate leader is doing to 
become the employer of choice in the marketplace.

You could expect a full house (around 400) for the talk.  If it fits into 
your schedule, Jack Bowen said he would be delighted to be honorary chairman 
of the event.

Mr. Christman:

Thank you for your invitation for Dr. Lay to speak at your upcoming forum in 
France, the format looks wonderful.  Unfortunately, Dr. Lay has calendar 
conflicts and will be unable to participate.

If you should need further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Hi Jaime -

Thanks for the information about the dinner.  Ken said that he would be 
flying from Aspen to New York (or Washington, if that's the city).  He said 
he would very much like to meet with you for 30 - 45 minutes before the 
dinner for a briefing.  

Thanks.

Subject: Dinner with V. Fox

Dear Ken,
 Federico Sada, who is travelling with President elect Vicente Fox in South 
America, called me this morning, 
and asked me to give you the confirmed list of attendees to the dinner in New 
York, Wednesday August 23, 8:00 P.M.
at the Watteau Room of the St. Regis Hotel:

 Sanford I. Weill   Citigroup, Inc.   Chairman and CEO
 Hendrick Verfaille  Monsanto Co.   President and CEO
 William B Harrison, Jr.  Chase Manhattan Corp.  Chairman and CEO
 Raymond V. Gilmartin  Merck and Company, Inc. Chairman and CEO
 Michael Armstrong  AT&T    Chairman and CEO
 Stephen M. Wolf  US Airways   Chairman and CEO
 Kenneth L. Lay   Enron Corp.   Chairman and CEO

Pending confirmation
 Douglas A. Warner III  J.P. Morgan   Chairman

According to Federico, if there is any late cancellation, no one will be 
substituted. Also, there is a small possibility that
the dinner could take place in Washington, rather than N.Y., based on Fox's 
meeting with President Clinton; they are still
working on the final agenda. 
 
 Max and myself are working on the background information that you will need, 
and will keep you posted of any 
changes; best regards,  jaime____

Our broadband business is doing great.  Just a few days ago, we announced a 
video-on-demand service we will be providing with Blockbuster.  It has 
created a lot of interest.

In general, my family is doing very well.  Linda and I now have six grandkids

Hi Kenny: Bonny sent me your E-mail address and
so I am trying it out. Sorry we could not make it
to the party. The temperature is very warm here
in Kansas today. I checked Enron stock recently
and it looks like it is doing fine. I am
particularly interested in your venture into the
fiber optics communications business and the
windpower. We sold our interest in the Cellular
business last year and I think the land line
company will be sold soon. We sold to Allied
Telephone Coimpany of Little Rock. Two other
engineers and myself put Kansas Cellular together
about 14 years ago. Then we built a fiber system
from East to West across Kansas. That was sold
with the Cellular. Take care of yourself-Loyal

Subject: Invitation to deliver 2001 IAEE conference keynote


Dear Ken:

Next April 25-27, 2001, Houston will host the 24th conference of the
International Association for Energy Economics, in combination with the
annual meeting of our U.S. Association for Energy Economics affiliate.  We
invite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon
on Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this
event.

Our theme is "2001: An Energy Odyssey." We are using the conference to
showcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to
deal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as
enterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to
clearly define these major themes and priorities than you.

I was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in
Montreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that
the regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t=
o
heart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the
opportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of
vital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include
comments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both
guiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in
markets on behalf of enterprises.

The IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business an=
d
university interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring yo=
u
up-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure
Rosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together
for you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc=
e
(at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In
addition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of
RD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues
and Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a
joint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology
Conference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas.

Finally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate
sponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project,
which you helped to found.  Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to hel=
p
identify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary
session, "Sustaining Development" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn
thinking around with our re-phrasing).

I hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.  We
look forward to having you with us next April!

Subject: World Economic Forum, Melbourne, Australia

The next World Economic Forum will be held September 11-13 in Melbourne.  I 
have received information from the Control Risks Group that several 
anti-capitalist and anarchist groups are planning major demonstrations to 
disrupt the proceedings. Like the earlier incidents in Seattle, large-scale 
clashes between demonstrators and police are expected.

If you or any of your staff members are planning to attend, you might want to 
consider your personal security when making hotel and local travel 
accomodations.  Corporate Security can provide local personal security agents 
if you desire.

Any non-essential travel to Melbourne during this time frame should be 
rescheduled.

Regards,

Mike Hicks




Hi Mr. Moore -

I'm sorry that we didn't discuss dates this morning as Mr. Lay is on vacation 
until September 5.  As that will be his first week back after being out for 
several weeks, it is already pretty booked up. 

I will certainly share this e-mail with him.  Is it possible to update Mr. 
Lay on the progress of the Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy by 
e-mail?  Another thought might be to see if our Executive Vice President of 
Human Resources, Cindy Olson,  would be available to meet with you on August 
28 or 29.  Ms. Olson is in charge of Enron's Community Relations Department.

Please advise.

Subject: Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy



I would like to schedule a short meeting in your office to  share the 
remarkable progress that the Committee to Encourage Corporate  Philanthropy 
is making and to ask that you consider hosting a meeting for  ten to fifteen 
CEOs of other major Houston corporations to encourage their  participation in 
the only forum of CEOs focused on the agenda of corporate  giving.
?
I'm anxious to meet you as we have so many friends in  common: three of your 
directors, John Duncan, Pug Winokur and Norm Blake, and  the Slocums, to name 
just a few.
?
I look forward to hearing from you.
?
?
P.S. If it works in your schedule, I'm available to come  to Houston on 
August 28 or 29 or anytime the week of September  4.


Diane, I will definitely show this to Ken, but he has a Dain Rauscher 
presentation near the Galleria at 8:00 a.m. that morning, so I know he can't 
attend.

Subject: Alzheimer's Research Update

On September 19th Dr. Bill Thies, vice president of medical and scientific 
affairs for the national Alzheimer's Association, will be in Houston to  
provide an update on some of the new and successful research underway for 
Alzheimer's disease.  He'll also be meeting with local reseachers to learn 
what they're doing in order to support and potentially fund their work.  
Since all of you have been such great supporters of our efforts to raise 
funds for this very cause, Phil and I are hosting a breakfast so you can hear 
firsthand how your money is being spent.  No pledge cards will be handed out 
at the door--just juice, coffee and maybe a bagel.  Please join us to hear an 
update from Dr. Thies on September  19 from 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. in the Enron 
Building, Room 49C1.  Please RSVP to Adriana Wynn at X55176.

Just a quick note to say good-bye and thank you after five and a half years!  
My last day at Enron will be Thursday, August 31st.  I will be heading off to 
two new jobs -- to be a full-time mom once Baby Lee arrives and to start my 
own stationary/invitations company.  

I have thoroughly enjoyed working with all of you.  Thank you for all the 
opportunities you have given me over the years.   For your Community 
Relations needs, Elyse Kalmans is heading up the department.  She can be

Subject: Governors Conference




Dear Ken, 

It was good to talk with you last week, and I hope you got some vacation in 
Aspen.? I'm working at it! 

Rosalie said you'd be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you 
by phone or e-mail before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you.? 
Governor Knowles (classmate of George W.), along with Governor Taft of Ohio, 
has enlisted us in a conference that seven governors are sponsoring on 
natural gas in order to elucidate the market and issues -- and needs -- 
before it explodes as a political issue -- and perhaps helps head it off (in 
contrast to what happened with gasoline).? Governor Knowles is the current 
chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be under the 
auspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and a lot of 
other distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very timely event.

They would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be kicking 
off the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high visibility 
platform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and honored -- to have 
you in that featured role in it works for your schedule.

It takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. 

Tony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms very 
large for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill you in 
further on what they would like to accomplish.

If it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, 
that would be great. 

On behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. 

Best, 

Dan 



I seem to have three appointments next week:

Tuesday, August 29:  Doctor appointment at 9:40 a.m. (enlightenment)

Wednesday, August 30:  Hair appointment @ 2:00 p.m (beauty)

Thursday, August 31:  Dental appointment @ 2:00 p.m. (ouch)


I plan to return to the office each day, but the dental appointment may take 
awhile.

Dar, are you on-line?  If so, please answer back.  I have questions.  Well, 
I'll ask them.  Did you get the wedding pics?

Hi Mr. Moore -

With regard to working out a convenient date to meet with  you, Rosalee has 
suggested that your week of September 4 is pretty well  booked-up. Would 
either September 11 or 13 work? After that I have to join Norm  Blake at the 
Olympics in Sydney. While all of this can de done by phone, as  deputy to the 
chairmen, I'm making every effort to meet (albeit briefly) with  each 
Committee member. If you are willing to host a meeting in Houston, I want  to 
make every effort to have Paul Newman in  attendance.


Joe, I am probably really missing something on this, but I can't determine 
when the big OECD Forum is.

Mr. Hines -

To get back with you re: your question about some kind of Futures/Options 
market in the commercial space market, Ken Lay said that to approach Jeff 
Skilling about it is absolutely the right approach.

I wanted to make sure you were aware of something that has come up since
the last breakfast meeting regarding our group financing the Arena parking
garage.  Baker & Botts put us in touch with the Rockets to discuss Hines
being the Development Manager on the Arena and garage.  Although not fully
agreed, there is strong interest on both sides.  Besides help on the
development front, we think there may be value in our acting as a bit of a
buffer between the Sports Authority and the Rockets and coordinating any
issues involving the new convention hotel(where we are also providing
development management).  The Rockets(Mike Goldberg-Baker & Botts) have
talked to Ric Campo and supposedly he is enthusiastic but thinks this
should "be the Authority's idea.".  One issue is how much of our fee would
apply to the garage, which presumably the city would pick up, and how much
would apply to the Arena.  Since this is a fast moving issue, I wanted you
to know about this. Obviously the discussions are all very confidential.
If you have any thoughts in advance of the next breakfast meeting, please
give me a call at 713-966-2606.

Also, on another topic, we have been doing a tiny bit of pie in the sky
brainstorming on the concept of creating some kind of Futures/Options
market in the commercial space market.  I will approach Jeff Skilling
unless you would recommend elsewhere within Enron.



Ken Lay asked me to advise you that he can't do this one, but would consider 
other dates.

Dear Dean Walker -

Ken Lay asked me to respond to you re:  1). naming the new professorship the 
Pinkney C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship - this is fine.
2)  He will be pleased to serve as the keynote speaker for the banquet on 
October 13.

Thanks.

Subject: P. Walker professorship and keynote request


Thanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the
professorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted that you plan to
attend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.

The purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient
way of reaching you, is two-fold:

     1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney
C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the
professorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some
other area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in
the College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.
Both Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into
Harold Hook to seek his input.

A few points of elaboration:
     * "Distinguished" is a standard adjective in the titles of such
positions.
     * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the
college to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my
approval.
     * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October
13.

This name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength,
(2) allows me to avoid any "turf battles" (either within the college or with
Economics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the
college.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.

     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society
banquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief
talk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of
business.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive
event.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now
live in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have
chosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.
Your talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed
(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.
I understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the
morning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable
for the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in
choosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you
will serve as the keynote speaker.

If you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the
plans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney
Walker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if
you have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is
573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.

Let me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not
Pinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been
experiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that
he intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.
Time permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll
see him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his
wife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I
will host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.  Of
course, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it's
my understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)

Ken, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of "R&R"
during your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.


Ms. Peppers, I am very sorry, but I must once again reschedule the 
appointment that you have with Mr. Lay.  He will be out of town the entire 
week of September 26.  

The first available time to reschedule is October 19, 2000.  Would an 
afternoon appointment work for you - about 2:00 p.m.?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Mr. Lay responded that he is unable to attend.  I know that you already have 
that message as someone has called, but I wanted to let you know also.

Hello Mr. Lay,

It's been a long time since we've talked.  I'm Priscilla Slade, President of
Texas Southern University.  The primary purpose of this e-mail is to invite
you to attend a weekend at the home of President and Mrs. Bush September
16-18.  So many people have expressed a desire to become know more about the
University (it's new initiatives and successes) that  President Bush
volunteered to host a gathering of 25 CEOs and spouses (or a second person
in the corporate hierarchy).  In addition to having fun golfing, sailing,
boating, etc., we are presenting ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT TEXAS SOUTHERN
UNIVERSITY.

I know this is your favorite topic and that we can look forward to you
joining us.  An invitation is in the mail.  I look forward to you joining
us.

Sincerely,

Priscilla

Mexico Meeting 2000
Managing New Expectations and Old Challenges
Mexico City, Mexico 4-5 December

Dear Dr Lay,

Mexico awoke to a new political landscape on 2 July 2000. The economic and 
business climate is positive and full of new opportunities as Mexico finally 
completes a long transition from one-party dominance to pluralist democracy, 
adding political maturity to a more competitive market economy.

In light of the above, the World Economic Forum will hold a Mexico Meeting 
2000 on 4-5 December in Mexico City. Held in collaboration with the Mexican 
Investment Board, this gathering will take place three days after the 
inauguration of the new Mexican administration. We have already received 
confirmation that President-elect Vicente Fox and Mexican Central Bank 
Governor Guillermo Ortiz will participate. We are also expecting the presence 
of the future key cabinet members and state governors.

As usual, the World Economic Forum pulls together the right group of leaders 
to discuss issues, build a network of contacts and identify where future 
business opportunities and risks lie. The Meeting will focus on four main 
topics: the country's political and social agenda, Mexico's commercial 
relationships with the rest of the world, the new economy and the key issues 
for the country's main industries.

Please consult our website, http://www.weforum.org/mexico, where information 
will be updated as soon as it becomes available.

For further information, please do not hesitate to contact Gisela Galicia at 
(41 22) 869 1450 or mailto:mexicomeeting@weforum.org

Subject: New PUHCA Exemption Legislative Language

Yesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the 
attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for 
companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by 
independent market analysts (i.e. "A" rating for Holding Companies or 
investment grade rating for utility companies).  This is not a permanent 
exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.

MidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's 
reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, 
Ken Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.

The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an 
amendment to a "must pass" piece of legislation during the waning days of 
this Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' 
strategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes 
tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as 
contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to 
paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth 
Edison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. 
2944).

Senator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA 
amendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed 
to the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've 
reviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the 
concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was 
Senator Kerrey's idea.  

It is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) 
would still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact 
that Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the 
Democrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not 
he is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive 
electricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is "at least 
three years away from happening."

Steve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position 
on this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to 
oppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like 
Southern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the 
MidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access 
provisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support. 





OOps, I can't seem to open it!!

Dear  Ken,

 I am sorry to say that earlier this week Arthur Levitt was called to
testify in Congress early on September 28, and he felt unable to make our
session as originally planned. It is my hope that we can reschedule with him
prior to -- or in conjunction with -- the final report. For those who may
have changed their schedules to make this meeting because of the chance to
talk to Arthur, I regret the inconvenience.

 In deference to your time, we'll go ahead with the meeting from 5 to
7 but not with the dinner.

 Here are the details of the meeting.  Note that the location is
different from the previous two meetings.

 Attached is the draft of our final report, prepared by Tim Koller.
It will be the subject of the meeting.  We will want to gather your comments
on the following:

     1.  Do you agree with the substance
of this draft?
     2.  Are there points that should
receive more or less emphasis?
     3.  Are there any other issues you
would like to raise?
     4.  Is there anything else about the
drafting and presentation that you would
like to comment on?

 We will need to get everyone's comments, one way or another, by the
end of September so we can proceed to prepare the final paper, which we'd
like to have ready by the end of October.

 Originally you said that you would not be able to make the meeting.
Could you let us know if your plans have changed and you can now come or
participate by phone?  See below for reply.

   ____ I will be there

   ____  I will participate by phone

Subject: Selection Of My Successor-My Concern

Ken: I have "heard" from two sources in this office that Enron will announce 
my successor today. I have not been advised of the selection and am concerned 
that this announcement will not treat my retirement in an appropriate and 
deserving manner.

I have placed calls to Steve Kean since hearing this rumor but have not 
received a response as of now. Admittedl, our phone service because of the 
office construction is not totally functioning.

Frankly, I think this matter has not been handled in a caring way and I have 
been acccused of giving information on the selection to Tom DeLay which is 
untrue. My office mates are all more aware of the candidates and their status 
than I have been.

I regret having to contact you on this matter but feel that despite my total 
cooperation, allegiance and dedication to Enron, I am not being treated with 
the courtesy and sensitivity that this matter deserves.

Shell's if I wait until Mr. Lay returns on October 3?  I have not been very 
successful getting faxes through to the ship, so would prefer not to have to 
bother him with this unless absolutely necessary.

Subject: Referendum Campaign


Mr. Lay--

I have been assisting John Watson with his representation of Sports
Facilities, L.P., and I am in the process of coordinating the $1.4 million
prepayment by the Sports Authority and the contribution of such amount by
the partners to the referendum campaign.

Assuming that we receive the prepayment from the Sports Authority, we expect
to be able to start making contributions to the referendum campaign this
week.  The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign by the
partnership, on behalf of each partner, upon receipt of instructions from
each such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributed
to the campaign instead of being distributed.  I have discussed this
procedure with Sue Walden.

With respect to your arrangement with Shell, we were not sure what you and
Shell had agreed to.  The monies being contributed to the referendum
campaign are being contributed to a special purpose political action
committee (as required by law).  This special purpose PAC is subject to the
general Texas laws that govern campaign fundraising.  As you know, one of
these laws provides that "a person may not knowingly make or authorize a
political contribution in the name of or on behalf of another unless the
person discloses in writing to the recipient the name and address of the
person actually making the contribution . . . ."   Pending a better
understanding of the Shell arrangement, we will hold Shell's $100,000 in the
partnership's account.

Please contact John Watson at 713-758-2556 or me at 713-758-2350 if you have
any questions regarding the foregoing.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Telle



Ken will not be here for the meeting.

Hi Michael -

Mr. Lay is returning from his trip today.  He will be in the office tomorrow.

Subject: Referendum Campaign


Mr. Lay--

During the negotiations with the Rockets as to how much each party would
contribute to the Arena referendum campaign, Mike Goldberg of Baker & Botts
suggested that the Rockets would like to net their contribution obligation
against other contributions that they solicited.

After a conversation with you, John Watson and I advised Mike Goldberg that
you did not want to be competing with the Rockets in soliciting
contributions to the Arena referendum campaign.

Mike Goldberg called Friday and asked whether it would be acceptable for the
Rockets to net against their contribution obligation contributions that they
have solicited from Baker & Botts, Jim MacInvale and Tilman Fertitta.  Mike
suggested that these three persons would be the only outside persons that
would be solicited by the Rockets.

Would you please let me know if this is acceptable to you.  You or Rosalee
may call me at 713-758-2350 or send me a response e-mail at
mtelle@velaw.com.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Telle

Hi Rosalee-- I just wanted to thank you so much for your extra help on our
inquiry to Ken.  We understand completely that the April 25 slot following
his return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's
always easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given recently
can easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of
my previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May to
the World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we
would work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new
content.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I
mentioned the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when it
comes to the idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy markets
and business enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and
don't hesitate to ever ask for a "quid pro quo" from us.

They will be receiving invitations to the Executive Forums scheduled here in 
Houston over the next few months.  But, I would be happy to invite them to a 
special Executive Forum, specifically for them, in London while you are 
there, your schedules permitting.  Please let me know if you would like me to 
try to arrange this.

Hi Colin -

Ken Lay asked me to advise you that this is fine with him.

Subject: Duchess of Northumbria's request

Ken

Thanks for sending me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help 
with her garden project.  I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our 
view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this, we 
should say a polite "no".

The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O'Neill, 
Managing Director of Lurgi Invent.

Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really 
is difficult to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work 
for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.  However, this 
business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see 
any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent.

Given the nature of the project, the approach from the Duchess and the fact 
that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself, we really do believe no is 
the right answer.

Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to 
correspond direct with the Duchess.

Best wishes.

Colin




Will you please do it, Colin?  Ken is in Japan.

Good morning, Liz -

I left a message at your home this morning that your Dad would like to speak 
with you when you have a chance to call.  

Rosie

p.s. - P. L. and I did early voting the first Saturday available!!  It was 
such a good feeling as Tuesdays are tough with trying to get to the office 
and leave in time to vote!!

Subject: Get out the Vote


Dear Friends and Family,
We are down to the wire and the race couldn't be
closer. Every vote counts, even those of you in Texas.
Please, remember to vote and go early, polls open at
7am across the country and close at 7pm but don't put
it off until 7pm as there could be lines and the
supervisors are not required to keep the polls open
after 7pm for those in line.
Remind your friends and family to vote and if someone
needs transportation to the polls, give them a ride or
call your local Victory 2000 office (Republicans) or
your local Democratic campaign office, they will have
people available to transport people to the polls.
Keep an eye out while you are at the polls for
electoral fraud and report any suspicious activity
including inappropriate campaigning to the poll
watchers at the polls. The Democrats and the
Republicans will have representatives at most of the
polls, let them know if there is suspicious activity.
Finally, if you have time, call your local offices and
offer your time to make phone calls to encourage
people to get out and vote, pass out leaflets, or to
be available to help prevent of voter fraud.

Finally, enjoy the evening and watch the results come
in. There are election watch parties everywhere!!!

Just one more day (and no more mass political e-mail's
from me and everyone else)!
Take care and VOTE!
Liz

Subject: e-Katz: Chief Kroeker


Over the past week I have heard from many thoughtful and concerned citizens
about their opinions on Chief Kroeker.  About an hour ago, I held a news
conference to release the statement below in response.  I wanted to make
sure you were able to read it in its entirety.

You are a part of my e-Katz list because of your work with me or my
administration.  To be removed from the "e-Katz" distribution list, simply
reply to this e-mail with your request.  If you have multiple e-mail
addresses you use, please include a name and/or company, otherwise we may
not be able to locate the correct entry to remove.  For more information on
the Katz administration, visit our website at
http://www.ci.portland.or.us/mayor.


Statement Regarding Police Chief Mark Kroeker

"I take my responsibilities as police commissioner very seriously.  I have
reviewed this situation with care.  I want to thank those who provided me
feedback either in person, over the telephone or through e-mail.

"The performance of any individual in my administration ultimately rests
with me.  I want to apologize for the concern, pain and fear caused by the
taped comments made years ago by Chief Kroeker.  His taped comments in no
way reflect my own personal beliefs.

"My community and staff discussions, along with reading all the e-mails and
transcripts of all my telephone messages, helped distill my thinking on this
issue to one key question: Can Chief Kroeker separate his personal religious
views from his professional conduct?

"I have determined that he manages his duties without bias and will continue
to do so. His performance has met my expectations.  He is leading the bureau
in a fair, respectful and inclusive manner.  He is moving our law
enforcement efforts to a higher level of community policing.  Therefore, I
have asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief of Police.  He has my strong
support to continue.

"The law provides that all city employees have a right to their personal
religious views.  I have a responsibility to review their employment status
if their actions, as a result of their personal views, impair their ability
to perform their professional responsibilities.

"Many of the arguments raised asking me to dismiss Mark Kroeker because he
is "out of step with Portland" could be used in other Oregon communities to
fire more liberal public officials who are "out of step" with their
community's conservative majority.  My 30-year fight for tolerance goes both
ways.

"Chief Kroeker will have to rebuild trust with many of our citizens.   He
assures me he is prepared to do so.  He told me he would rather help undo
the damage, help me promote tolerance and acceptance of all people, than
just walk away.

"He commits to a strong and sustained positive dialogue with Portlanders who
are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, including those on his staff.
He has already begun outreach efforts and will continue to do so.

"He said he will redouble his efforts to promote respect and acceptance of
all Portlanders and be steadfast and fair in his enforcement of the law.

"He agrees to work with the Cascade Aids Project to serve as a spokesperson
to educate citizens about the fact that AIDS is not a "gay disease."

"He will continue to seek advice from the City Council, the Bureau's Sexual
Minority Roundtable and others to guide additional efforts.

"He agrees to take all this on with all his heart.

"In the process I hope he and we all learn from this experience.  I will
work to turn this negative situation into a positive one: to expand our
sense of tolerance; to promote the notion that regardless of a person's
personal or religious beliefs, one can be an effective public servant; and
to deepen the acceptance of all Portlanders.

"As Mayor, I will do my part and more.  I hope you will join me."




Gary, every time Ken tells me to report it, I tell Anna or Kristi and they, 
in turn, pass it on to whoever they deal with in Maintenance.  It has been at 
least 3 times.

Gary, 
Least I forget!  On N5737 the other day (11/18) Mr. Lay reported to Bill 
Reddick that when his phone (#2 R/H seat) rings and he answers that it 
disconnects on him.  He told Bill that this is the third time he has reported 
this problem.  I spoke personally with Bill about this.  We checked and there 
is no record of this problem reported recently (we checked back to May 2000) 
on all three Falcon 900's.

Lyndel checked the system and there does seem to be a problem with it 
disconnecting if you pick it up before the third ring.  After the third ring 
it works fine.  That is all I know at this time.  Garrett Av is coming over 
today to check the system.

I know you don't like emails but I didn't want this it slip by.  I've 
discussed this with Ron and John as well.

Keith



Ken will be there.

Mike has suggested that we cut back  board meetings to fewer than the eight 
(8) we currently hold.? In order to  give you some background, Linda checked 
other peer companies and the meetings  range from 6 to 8 a year.? 
?
I think that we can cut back to 6,  however it may be more prudent to drop to 
7 this year and first see how it goes  .? The two meetings that can be 
dropped most easily are June or  September.? 
?
June,  because we have the two day strat  plan meeting in July, and Sept. 
because we don't yet have 4th quarter results  and not a lot of new 
information is available.
?
I think that the board meetings take up   an incredible amount of Compaq 
executive time and energy. I would rather have  them concentrate on getting 6 
or 7 meetings right, getting the company back on  track and? increasing 
earnings.? So, my vote is to?recommend to the board that we  eliminate the 
September '01 meeting.? That is a particularly busy month for  many people as 
exhibited by the lack of attendance we had at this past September  meeting (5 
members).? In looking back, we seem to be able to "fill the  house" in June.
?
On the other hand, you all may want to  continue with the number of meetings 
we currently have.? I will await your  reply.

Ken,

Sorry to miss you today when I called. Since I am leaving for India in a
few minutes, I thought I would sent you an E-mail, and then I can try to
call you from India. Because of the time difference, it will not be easy
for us to connect. Unfortunately I will not be back in the US until
December 7.

The reason for my call was to see if you would feel comfortable putting my
name forward to Dick Cheney for a position in the new administration. I am
not sure where the best fit would be, but it might be Chairman of the
National Economic Council. That job has a good combination of management
and economics. You know I have only been associated with Democratic
administrations in past, but Democratic administrations were a little
different in those days. You are somewhat familiar with my record on
economics and there is a lot on that in the public domain.

Just let me know what you think. Maybe a quick E-mail would suffice ( I am
carrying my computer).

Best regards,
Bill

 Jim Harmon, Chairman of EXIMBank will be in Houston March 15 and would like 
to meet with Enron to see where there are opportunities for EXIM to work more 
closely with the company.  He will be accompanied by Jeff Miller VP who 
oversees the finance operations and perhaps Barabara O"Boyle, head of the 
project finance group.  As you know we have done little with the Bank since 
Trakya. We intended to use the Bank for Dabhol 2 but were prevented to by 
sanctions imposed against India.  Joe is now on the EXIM Advisory Committee 
so it would be a good opportunity to sit down with the Bank. 
 I understand that Ken has received a letter from EXIM about the meeting and 
referred it to Joe.  I would propose that Joe lead the meeting with some of 
the regional finance people (parallel the Munoz schedule, but shorter) with a 
brief courtesy call on Ken or Ken could step in for a moment whenever he is 
available.
 I will check with Pam re Joe's availability and follow up with a memo re the 
market window initiative with EXIM where my office is heavily involved.


Here it is!!  Have a great day!!  Stay warm.

Ken and Jeff,

As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the 
Enron Associate program for several years now.  I also recently have become 
involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which 
provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.  They 
are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will 
include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their 
company's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to 
ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would 
really highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a "Core School" in 
the MBA recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for 
March 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.

Kevin

Kevin-


Just a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding Enron's
participation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week and the
possibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had a
chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on
you plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. 
Below is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all
is well with you.


            Nov.2 email text


We at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link
with Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the
agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable
markets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like
Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic
Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and
beyond.


The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. 
First, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key
speaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As
described in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three
conferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and
students.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a "live
case study" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,
2001</underline>.


You, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this
is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay
and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and
the Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the
corporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken
Chenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced
President of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a
distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in
continually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  


We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership
Week, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman
Sachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company
and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank
Rhodes, but these are still long shots.


The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the
Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted
a platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If
they can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the
date is March 28, 2001.       


The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same
lines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it
could become the basis for the March conference live case study
presentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to
literally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage
an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place
that you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to
be the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and
practices make this possible.


I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around
1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and
leadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to
building this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer
from the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the
Enron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast
moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient
way.


Kevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and
hopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to
make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. 
Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As
always, thanks for your great personal support.


Dick




Dear Kelly:

I appreciate your comments regarding Enron's advertising focus.  First, Enr=
on=20
become involved  with Enron Field for two reasons:  to keep the Astros in=
=20
Houston and to gain energy and facilities management business for Enron=20
Energy Services.  Acquiring the naming rights to the stadium came much late=
r=20
in our negotiations with the Astros.  In addition, while sports events like=
=20
NASCAR are exciting to watch and get a fair amount of media play,  we're=20
targeting a more specific audience with our advertising dollars.
 =20
Increasingly, Enron=01,s integrated products and services require the appro=
val=20
of an organization=01,s highest ranking officers, people who carry a =01&CX=
O=018=20
title, such as chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief=20
information officer or chief technology officer. These individuals may not=
=20
recognize Enron=01,s name and abilities as readily as energy-centric execut=
ives.

We also want to reach the elected and appointed officials who set policy an=
d=20
regulations affecting Enron businesses worldwide. The "Ask Why" advertising=
=20
campaign launched in February this year was designed with these groups in=
=20
mind as well as to put the Enron name and image on everyone=01,s radar scre=
en.=20
Enron commercials continue to appear on business channels such as CNBC and=
=20
CNNfn, as well as the History Channel, ESPN and network news programs. Some=
=20
are running in Europe as well.

While we won't rule out entirely the possibility of directing some of our=
=20
future advertising dollars toward sports events, for now, we believe we are=
=20
spending our ad budget where it will have the greatest positive impact on o=
ur=20
business.

Thanks for your suggestion.  Keep them coming.

Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges

California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc=

offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o=
f=20
distributed generation.
=20
Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20
investor-owned and municipal utilities

Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =
a=20
step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20
interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=
=20
requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20
generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=
=20
interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=
=20
through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20
possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=
e=20
utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20
accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.

Permitting and Air Quality Issues
Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=

In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=
=20
face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20
interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=
. =20
These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.

3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=
=20
Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20

Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=
=20
suppliers.
Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=
e=20
goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.
However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=
=20
concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.
We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=
redit=20
risk concerns.
Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=
=20
is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=

both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=
=20
going forward.

such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=
es=20
adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.

Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018
The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=
=20
=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=
use to=20
allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20
purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=
ee=20
to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=
=20
DWR has entered into with suppliers.
=20
Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=
=20
Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases
In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=
=20
noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=
=20
the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=
oy to=20
permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=
s=20
extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=
re=20
DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =
is=20
difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=
=20
rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=
=20
costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=
=20
suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=
=20
from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.

Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20

We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=
sk=20
issues.  We have identified three options:

Amend AB1X
The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=
=20
PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=
red by=20
DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =
to=20
ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=
=20
preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=
=20
challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20
entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)

Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20
through Contract Language
This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20
implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=
re=20
time to implement than the "legislative" fix.  We have attached electronic=
=20
copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=
=20
would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20
=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)

Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk
As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=
cept=20
other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=
=20
cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=
=20
indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=
=20
prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=
=20
contract amendments.

4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001

Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20
Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=
=20
showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=
r=20
only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=
l=20
credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=
=20
of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20
likely. =20

CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20
summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20
estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=
 well=20
below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=
n=20
in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=
=20
than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20
unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=
o=20
date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=
he=20
flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20
California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =
this=20
requirement. =20

Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=
=20
draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=
re=20
supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=
=20
number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20
utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=
t=20
pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=
=20
added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.

CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=
=20
rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20
optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=
=20
MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=
=20
should view the CEC's "rosy scenario" with considerable skepticism.

5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=
=01,s=20
Electricity Crisis

This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=
l=20
deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=
=20
bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.

As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20
crisis must focus on four issues:

Increase supply
Decrease demand
Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market
Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency

Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)
To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =
=20
Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=
=20
than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.

The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=
slation=20
are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=
se=20
efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=
=20
in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20
requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=
=20
proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20
transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20
innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20
emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=
ir=20
districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20
required reductions in pollution emissions.

Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)
Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=
=20
the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=
=20
best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=
st=20
effectively and quickly in two ways:

Buy-down demand
California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=
d=20
to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=
 more=20
economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=
ld=20
be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=
=20
through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20
determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20
participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20
necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20
reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=
eal=20
Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.

Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment
To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:

An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=
=20
for hour-ahead power in real time.=20
Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=
=20
verification.
Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=
=20
paid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).

The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=
e:

=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=
cularly=20
in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=
=20
resources.
reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20
electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =
in=20
the state.
fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=
k=20
of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20
customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=
=20
responding.=20

We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=
=20
excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=
=20
summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate=
=20
that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=
s=20
that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20
directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20
control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.

Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=
cle:=20
SB27X
The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=
re=20
customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=
=20
service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=
=20
customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=
e=20
prohibition against Direct Access.

Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=
=20
direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o=
f=20
Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from=
=20
customer migration. =20

In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=
=20
the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme=
nt=20
is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20
condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20
therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20
function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20
non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ=
ia=20
should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period =
in=20
which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments=
=20
of utility load.

Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative =
vehicle:=20
AB18X
Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand=
. =20
In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20
imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers=
=20
and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ=
ia=20
State government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend=
ed=20
period of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=
e=20
in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20
participate in that market.

California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=
=20
series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20
increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without=
=20
=01&shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California c=
ould=20
amortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year perio=
d. =20
In addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:=
=20
First, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in=20
recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of =
AB=20
1890.  Second, California can =01&net=018 the revenues the utilities have r=
eceived=20
from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav=
e=20
accrued due to the retail price cap.

We plan to distribute the final draft by mid-March in time for you to take
one last careful look before a conference call at the end of the month, and
also for you to submit any supplementary views for inclusion. My suggestion
is that views be kept to a few paragraphs, if possible. For those who wish
to write one, you could disagree with part of the report, you could suggest
a slightly different emphasis on some aspect of the report, or you could
underline some aspect that you are especially enthusiastic about and believe
deserves more attention.

When we send the next draft to you I'll try to propose something about how
we might release the report, but I would appreciate any suggestions you have
about that.

Here are two proposed dates for our next conference call. Please indicate
your availability by preference (#1, #2).

(#2) Wednesday, March 28, 5-6:30 PM
     (Eastern Standard Time)

(#1) Thursday, March 29, 5-6:30 PM
     (Eastern Standard Time)

Could you also send us the precise way that you would like your name and
title to appear in the report?

Many thanks,

Jeff Garten

Dear Mr. Lay,

     Enron's  dynamic growth in the field of energy
during the last three years is truly remarkable. As a
student of business, I am truly impressed by the
strategic acquistions made by Enron in the area of
power and its leveraged arbitrage with the gas
industry.
     I would very much like to make a career within
Dynegy and would appreciate very much if you would
consider me for a Management trainee position in your
esteemed organization. Enclosed is a copy of my
resume.

Sincerely,

Asad Rashid

Freedom of Press 'under threat' in Russia, campaigners claim

Russia's provincial media is struggling to maintain its freedoms in the face
of politically motivated assaults, campaigners claim.

Oleg Panfilov, chief of the Centre for Journalism in Extreme Situations,
said: "A new state propaganda machine is being created in the federal
districts, with new state-run newspapers, new state-run news agencies, new
state-run TV channels."

Fyodor Penkin, chief editor of the Volga Times, who survived a shotgun
attempt on his life earlier this year, said: "Ten years ago, when I was
creating this newspaper, I felt for the first time that I can write freely.
Now this child I have created is dying before my eyes."

Media's role in Ghana's presidential election praised

Ghana's acting ambassador to the US has offered a glowing account of the
role played by his country's media in the recent presidential election.

Francis Tsegah said radio in particular played a significant part in
ensuring the success of the election - Ghana's first multi-party one.

He said:  "The press covered the parties and were able to send information
to the public in such a way that by the time you had the election there was
no longer any question of the media being biased towards one party."

The election was won by opposition candidate John Kufuor.

Widow of murdered Ukrainian journalist abandons "na<ve" search for truth

The widow of murdered Ukrainian journalist Georgiy Gongadze told how she has
despaired of ever uncovering the truth about his death.

Myroslava Gongadze said her "endless moves" to find out what happened to her
husband were "na<ve".

The journalist's headless body was found near Kiev. Gongadze was a fierce
critic of the Ukrainian government, which has been implicated in his death.

Malaysia increases pressure on media

Malaysia has increased pressure on both foreign and domestic media, by
branding people involved in award-winning news site Malaysiakini.com
"traitors" and delaying the distribution of the latest issues of Asiaweek
and the Far Eastern Economic Review (FEER).

Prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said of Malaysiakini: "People who love
Malaysia would not support Malaysiakini. Previously people would say
traitors but these people really behave like traitors, asking foreigners to
harm their own country."

Two Asiaweek issues and one of FEER - all carrying articles on Malaysia -
were stuck in distributions depots, and FEER Managing Editor Michael
Vatikiotis said: "We have no indication as to whether this is just a one off
or part of a policy. We have had no official communication."

Asiaweek is part of the AOL-Time Warner stable, and FEER part of Dow Jones.

Taiwan vows to safeguard free speech over controversial book

Taiwan's President Chen Shui-ban has vowed to safeguard the island's freedom
of speech as a row over a controversial Japanese comic book continued to
divide the state.

The book claimed that many Taiwanese women, forced to act as sex slaves to
Japanese soldiers during World War Two, were volunteers. Some politicians
demanded the cartoonist be denied a visa to visit Taiwan while others
insisted that he be allowed his freedom of speech.

BBC's Sambrook pledge to "get below the hype"

BBC News director Richard Sambrook has vowed to improve the quality of his
empire's output by better integrating its disparate parts, and "getting
below the hype".

In an interview with The Times' media editor, Ray Snoddy, Sambrook, who
officially takes the director's chair this week from the departing Tony
Hall, says he is running a "fantastic operation". But, he admits, it
"misfires slightly as we go down the road. We do not quite pack the punches
that we ought to".

Sambrook says he has discussed how best to coordinate journalists in the UK
regions, and World Service, with senior BBC executives.

Broadcasters face curbs in Singapore

Foreign broadcasters who "engage in the domestic politics of Singapore"
could soon face restrictions.

Information and Arts Minister Lee Yock Suan said he was set to introduce a
bill that would allow the government to restrict distribution of a broadcast
service if the company was deemed to be meddling in the city-state's
internal affairs.

Singapore's Newspaper Act can ban distribution of a newspaper or magazine
and has been used against The Economist and Asian Wall Street Journal, but
up until now broadcasters have been left alone.

Lee said foreign media operated in Singapore as a matter of privilege, not
of right.

He added: "Our aim is not to ban information but to restrict subscriber and
advertising revenue to an errant channel."

Australia's ABC must decentralise to lessen Sydney bias, MD says

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation must decentralise both staff and
activities to prevent it from becoming a Sydney mouthpiece, managing
director Jonathan Shier said.

Shier said that by June 2003, the ABC wanted to increase its
non-news/current affairs production in centres other than Sydney or
Melbourne by 40 percent.

He also said that the internet had its place within media and should not be
sidelined just because of the recent dot com gloom.

Unions claim that the decentralisation talk is just a "stalking horse for
getting rid of staff".

Journalist Ware reportedly offered safe house by BBC

The BBC has reportedly offered a safe house to Panorama reporter John Ware,
the journalist most closely associated with the expose on the Omagh bombing.

According to the Times newspaper, the Corporation has also offered Ware
personal protection.

The bomb blast outside the BBC's west London centre is being blamed on the
Real IRA, who may have acted in revenge over the Panorama reports.

Meanwhile, speculation that the BBC might move flagship current affairs
programme Panorama back to a weekday slot - but on BBC2 - refuses to go
away.

MediaGuardian quotes an 'insider' as saying: "Sunday may just have been a
transition. If it moved to a weekday slot, possibly even to BBC2, it would
increase its audience and get more share."

The BBC has insisted that Panorama will remain in its Sunday night slot,
despite opposition from some prominent figures, including Ware.

Indonesian copies of Time censored by distributor

The Indonesian distributor of Time Magazine censored pictures of headless
corpses -victims of the ethnic bloodshed in Indonesia's Central Kalimantan
province - in the Asian edition of the magazine, as he feared it would
incite more violence.

The front cover image and photographs inside the magazine, where decapitated
bodies were shown, were blacked out by hand in all copies being sent to
Indonesia. The distributor said it had not come under pressure from the
government to censor the pictures.

Time journalist Jason Tedjasukmana said he was concerned that the move could
lead to other companies taking censorship into their own hands.

UK broadcasters on guard against online poll rigging in Election run-up

The UK's top broadcasters have pledged to be on alert for attempts by
political activists to rig online polls in the run up the General Election.

The BBC's assistant director of news Mark Damazer told how the Corporation
had ran a poll during its Europe week coverage, only to inadvertently
receive an e-mail from a pressure group asking its supporters to '"keep
e-mailing this site, we need to get in as many votes as we can".

And ITN's editor-in-chief Richard Tait said: "We are going to be extremely
careful not to allow any online polling to be hijacked by an individual
group."

In its birthday special "Seven Ages of Murdoch", the site tells Murdoch's
life story in seven animated cartoons. Its online birthday card has Murdoch
cutting a cake in the shape of the globe.

Tributes have been sent by The Telegraph's proprietor Conrad Black and

admire his achievements which are immense indeed." Visitors can send their
own tributes to the site's editor.

I am disappointed that Joe Grundfest will not be able to join us at our next 
Advisory Council meeting.  However Tom Campbell sounds like an excellent 
alternative.  Would you please contact him and see if he might be willing to 
join us for the next meeting and talk about the subjects you suggested.  
Incidentally, we're happy to pay an honorarium to any of our guest speakers. 

I think I should pass at this time on inviting Spence Abraham to join us for 
dinner.  First, I believe it would be virtually impossible for him to do that 
at this point in time.  But second, many people are already blaming me for 
being the real energy policy maker in the new Administration and I would just 
as soon not feed that speculation.  

Look forward to seeing you.  

Warm regards,

Ken

Joe and I hve had several conversations trying to work out his schedule, but
his classes plus moving his parents from NYC to California at that time make
it impossible for him to come, although he would very, very much like to do
so.
I would suggest that we invite Tom Campbell, the Republican congressman who
just lost his shot at the senate against one of the two women (I forget which
one, left or lefter) and who is again teaching at Stanford Law School. He is
brilliant, and we could give him the topic of "Enron and Market-Regulatory
Failure: What Are The Constraints on Its Behavior? Where Do the Risks Lie in
the Future?" Or some such thing.
I will read When Genius Fails in the next few hours and decide about its
author.
What would you think of having Spence Abraham to dinner, and moving Bill
Kristol to the morning if Spence can come?


Hi Tom - this would be good as Ken Lay will not be able to attend next week.

Thank you for making yourself available this afternoon. We want to apprise
you of recent developments and our planned responses.  The regular Board
Meeting is scheduled for next week. This may not be required in view of the
discussions we'll have this afternoon.  We'll confirm this afternoon whether
the Board Meeting is required.


Thanks, Anabella, as I couldn't figure out why Mr. Lay received it.

Hi Rebecca -

In fact, the Consul General of Ghana, Jack Webb, has called Ken asking him to 
meet with the Ambassador to Ghana March 10 or 11 when he will be in Houston.  
I had put a message on Ken's messages last evening asking if you could handle 
this if you are available, so hopefully he will say yes - especially after he 
sees your message.

Ken.

I wanted to get back with regarding your question of Ghana.  You might 
remember that Ralph Hodge had indicated to you that you may well be hearing 
from the Ghanaian Ambassador.  Ralph believes that he will try to facilitate 
a meeting between you and Chevron.

We have been working Ghana pretty hard, including the West African Gas 
Pipeline, the Effasu Power Project, a marketing company and a host of other 
possibilities.  We have told the Ghanaians that with what is going on right 
now in Nigeria, the loss of projects in Cote d'Ivoire due to the coup d'etat, 
and the lack of speed in moving forward in Ghana , that we are slowing down a 
bit to determine if we can resolve current projects before taking on 
additional ones.  

Clearly this is a bit of a "cop out".  I am reluctant to tell Ghana that we 
are slowing down generally in Africa because I don't want to hurt the barge 
deal or jepordize the possible resolution of the large snowball in Mozambique 
and there is truth to the Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria issues.  And, of course, 
I don't want to alienate Ghana generally.  I have a good relationship with 
the Ambassador from Ghana, in fact, I just got a postcard from him two days 
ago, and when he returns to the US he has indicated that he will call me.  I 
will deliver this message, hopefully diverting the call to you.  If he does 
get to you first, he won't be upset for you to send him on to me, I don't 
believe.

If there is any clarification, please give me a holler.  I hope the office 
opening has gone well.  I've extracted many a promise from participants to 
drink a pint for me.

Regards
Rebecca


Hi Mr. Stelzer l-

I don't believe Ken has had an opportunity to review the suggestions in your

Dear Nicolas:

I am pleased that you found the Cancun meeting to be a good experience.  My 
wife and I also thought if was a very enjoyable couple of days.

With reference to contacting the appropriate people representing Enron in 
Mexico, you should contact either Jaime Alatorre or Max Yzaguirre.  Either 
one of these individuals could entertain a discussion of how we might be able 
to work together.

Best regards,

Ken

interesting experience to attend this forum.

I would like to know more about your activities in our country. If it is

Hi Jonathan -

E-mail is great.  I have copied Tori Wells on this also, as she works 
diligently on Dr. Lay's itineraries and Rob Bradley, who works on Dr. Lay's 
speeches.  We have virtually no information about the OECD Forum or the IEA 
Ministerial session except dates - May 15-16.  We have made reservations for 
Dr. & Mrs. Lay at the Bristol Hotel.  

We look forward to hearing from you.

Rosalee --  I was given your name by Bill Ramsay as the person responsible

From the IEA side, I have been tasked with the responsibility for
co-ordinating not only parts of the Ministerial session, but also the
preceding OECD Forum -- in both of which Mr. Lay is scheduled.

I am hoping to be in closer communication with you to walk through our
current planning for these meetings, and to make sure that all our i's are
dotted and t's are crossed as we move toward May.  Please let me know
whether e-mail or a telephone call would be best.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Subject: Final items of the MC



Hello John,
I hope you have returned to normal after the MC!!!  I can only say that it
was a tremendous success, and everyone should be congratulated that worked
on the planning!
Now to the final items.  We are billing everyone for the hotel, golf and
regatta this week and we have a few questions.  The hotel and golf are easy.
However the regatta is a different situation.  When we started this project,
the cost of the regatta was much less than when we finished.  We quoted
$85.00 per person, however the Millennium rate was actually $100.00 per
person.  This would not be such a great problem, however we had 33 no-shows
for the regatta.  This being said, we have two choices.  We bill those that
sailed for an additional $15.00 to make their charge $100.00 which then
leaves us with a negative $3500.00.  Or, we also bill the 33 no-shows for
$100.00 each which puts us pretty close to break even.
In the big picture, there have been some budget cost that were less than
expected and some that were more.  We will have the final budget complete by
the end of next week.
The most important issue, is it acceptable to bill those that sailed $100.00
or do you want us to stay at the original price of $85.00?......Then, of
course, what should we do about the no shows?  Possibly bill them a
cancellation fee or the full fee?  Or, forget and forgive this time?
I am leaving for Paradise tomorrow, however my trusted partner Janelle will
be here until the 20th of January.  We would like to get everything
finalized before she leaves.
Give us your thoughts.

Mr. Platt -

Ken Lay said that he will approve the $10,000 underwriter costs to be one of

to see if Joe Sutton, the Vice Chairman of Enron, might be able to attend.  I

Please ask Mr. Radtke to send an invoice to Enron, unless there is some

Subject: Dornbusch on Income Inequality and Pricing AIDS Medications to a  
Human Scale


Dear Dr. Lay:

New this week on www.TheGlobalist.com:

RUDI DORNBUSCH ON INCOME INEQUALITY
Poverty is bad -- but income inequality is not. MIT Professor Rudi
Dornbusch makes the argument that the development community
should not confuse inequality with poverty -- even though at the
bottom they might feel the same.

Coming Monday: A New Globalist Paper
PRICING AIDS MEDICATIONS TO A HUMAN SCALE
In a scramble for good publicity, pharmaceutical companies have
started a downward bidding war in pricing AIDS medications for
African markets. To add a much-needed measure of fairness to
the process, we propose a better alternative -- adjusting the price
of treatment to per-capita GDP.

Best regards from Washington,

Stephan Richter
Publisher and Editor-in-Chief

Also this week:

JAPAN -- DON'T TRUST ANYONE OVER 55!
During the course of its decade-long economic malaise, Japan
has tried just about every trick in the book to get its economy
growing again. We may have found the answer -- but be warned,
those over the age of 55 may not like it!

CHINA'S CARIBBEAN ISLAND HIDEAWAY
Why does China have an embassy on the tiny Caribbean island
of St. Lucia -- an island 8,000 miles away from Beijing and with which
it has few economic or political ties?

Coming Friday: A New Globalist Bookshelf Feature
ROBERT KAPLAN ON THE TURKEY-ISRAEL AXIS
Turkey is in the midst of an economic crisis -- and Israel's relations
with the Palestinians have steadily deteriorated. So what do these
countries have to gain by forming a strategic alliance?

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: NEW ANSWERS TO NEW PROBLEMS=20

For more than a century, our system for protecting intellectual property=20

******E-NEWS THIS WEEK*******

OPEC ANNOUNCE 1M BBL/D CUTS
Geneva - OPEC members agreed further production cuts this week, announcing a
further 1m bbl/d decrease in member outputs. As a result oil prices pushed
slightly higher with NYMEX crude trading at $26.80 and IPEC crude trading at
25.06. OPEC ministers have indicated that members have highlighted $25/bbl
as a price that they feel comfortable with.The decreases per country were as
follows:

Algeria - 32,000
Indonesia - 52,000
Iran - 146,000
Kuwait - 80,000
Libya - 54,000
Nigeria - 82,000
Qatar - 26,000
Saudi Arabia - 324,000
UAE - 88,000
Venezuela - 116,000
Total - 1,000,000


ENERGY AFRICA LOOK TOWARD THE MOROCCAN DEEP
Rabat - This week the MENA Petroleum Bulletin spoke with Andrew Windham,
Group General Counsel for Energy Africa. Amina Benkhadra, General Manager of
ONAREP (25%) added to the growing list of re-entrants to Morocco, signing a
petroleum agreement with Energy Africa (63.75%) and Taurus Petroleum AB
(11.25%). This agreement, taking effect March 1st 2001, concerned three
exploration permits offshore Morocco collectively known as the Tiznit
Offshore area.
Energy Africa Morocco Ltd (operator), together with Taurus Petroleum
(co-partner) will implement exploration work on the three permits of the
Tiznit Offshore area covering approximately 6000sq.km. This is Energy
Africa's second Petroleum Agreement covering acreage offshore Morocco, the
first being the Cap Draa Haute Mer area where Energy Africa holds 20% equity
bringing the total acreage held by it in the country to 18,000sq.km.
Andrew Windham, said, 'the country has all the characteristics offshore
which make potentially, for substantial discoveries. But at this stage it is
very much untried and untested, so it is a very exciting place to be at the
moment. We are in right at the start of some new plays.'
For further details please see the April issue of the MENA Petroleum
Bulletin.


REPSOL MAKE 2ND LIBYA DISCOVERY
London - Repsol YPF SA said it discovered oil at a second well during
exploration in Libya. The well in the Murzuq Basin, 800km south of Tripoli,
produced oil at a rate of 1,300bbl/d, the company said in a press release.
Repsol is testing the site on behalf of a consortium including OMV,
TotalFinaElf and Saga Petroleum. Repsol began searching for oil in the area
in May 1998, when the Libyan government granted approval for exploration and
production sharing arrangements with foreign companies. The companies
currently produce more than 160,000bbl/d from the Murzuq Basin, said the
company.


AHMED ABDELKARIM CONFIRMED AS NEW HEAD OF NOC
Tripoli - Further to reports this week from Libya Ahmed Abdel-Karim Ahmed
has been formally appointed as Chairman of NOC, following reports that he
had been removed from the position. Representing Libya at the OPEC
conference in Geneva it was confirmed that Al-Badri has been appointed as
Deputy Prime Minister for Social Security. The news will comfort foreign
investors who feared that further upheaval would hinder an already slow
ratification process, with approvals outstanding for three packages of
blocks offered by NOC in late 2000.

*****MARKET ANALYIS REPORT NEWS*****

ALGERIAN OIL AND GAS REPORT
Approximately 90% of Algeria's crude oil exports go to Western Europe, with
Italy as the main market followed by Germany and France. Algeria accounts

demands of Iberia and the Eastern Mediterranean Basin. This will depend upon
the degree to which foreign investment can be attracted.

in Algeria, and the prime and potential markets for Algerian energy
products. Specifically, the Report will provide you with a complete analysis
on
* All major oil and gas field/projects.

MENA POWER
23 & 24th April 2001, Crowne Plaza Hotel, Dubai
For further information visit
http://www.smi-online.co.uk/middleeastpower2.asp

The timing of this conference couldn't be better as the Middle East and
North African region gears up to offer further independent power projects.

SMi forthcoming conference titled Middle East North African Power, taking
place 23rd and 24th April 2001 aims to bring together all levels of
participants to explain their understanding and thinking for the future of
Middle East and North African power development.

Many countries experience blackouts and electrical faults on a daily basis,
governments in the Middle East and North Africa are now increasingly pinning
their hopes on the Independent Power Project run in conjunction with major
International investors to solve this problem.   Relaxation of Middle East
law has allowed outside investment and many see this moving the Middle East
power industry towards privatisation.

Key Speakers at this event include:
* Engineer Mahmoud Al-Ees, Head of Planning Studies, Ministry of Energy and
Mineral Resources - Jordan
* Dr Ranald Spiers, Regional Director Middle East & Africa, National Power
Plc
* Steve Wildman, Commercial Director, Alstom Gas Turbines
* Tom Thomason, Project Manager, InterGen
* Daniel J. Meier, Area Sales Manager, ABB High Voltage Technologies
* Dr Thomas Stauffer, International Oil and Finance Consultant (Formerly
with M.I.T)

MENA Power takes place on 23rd & 24th April 2001 at the Crowne Plaza Hotel,
Dubai.  The full conference programme is available at

A review of SMi's Algerian Management Report can be found on:
http://www.smi-online.co.uk/algeria.asp

The Aims & Objectives of the Conference

Algeria has always attracted a large amount of interest from the
international oil and gas community.  With a new licensing round under
discussion and petroleum code under review, this conference aims to act as a
forum for all aspects of the oil and gas industry to come together and
discuss the future development of Algeria's oil and gas sector.  Moving away
from the traditional investing in format of conference, this forum aims to
look at specific field studies and also the future markets and developments
within the Algerian oil and gas industry.  It will focus on the commercial
opportunities that exist in helping Algeria reach these markets and allow
for strategic analysis of the impact of this supplier.  It will examine
current MENA energy flows and how they might look in the future with Algeria
asserting its role as the Mediterranean's major producing nation.

discuss your participation in more detail, please contact Wendy Parker the

dinner with Congressman DeLay and others on Friday, April 6th.

BACKGROUND  During the last week of February, BCCA and Partnership leaders
met separately with Congressman DeLay, Congressman Joe Barton and with two
top staff members of Mr. DeLay, in order to update them on our extensive
activities aimed at federal Clean Air Act compliance.  Pursuant to those
meetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be
held in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area on
that day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman
of the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House
Committee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has
oversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and
interaction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.

APRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's
congressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local
officials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship
channel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.
We are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.

He has asked to end the day with a "small dinner with CEOs" to have a frank
discussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called
your office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he
and the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in
addressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we
also invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.
DeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will
obviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and advise
on strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in
attendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in
advance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before or
after the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.

RSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim
Edmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan
and Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan
Smith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.
We will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies to
attend the dinner.

My current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and
to arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at a
board member's home nearby.

I trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the
Partnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with
any questions you may have.  Thank you.

CALL TO ACTION

Alliance Activists Can Make a Difference

As the country deals with a mounting energy crisis, the Department of Energ=
y
(DOE) may be planning an estimated 30-35 percent cut in the energy
efficiency and renewable energy research and development programs budget.
The Alliance calls on all responsible citizens to  encourage the
administration to do the right thing.  Becoming an Alliance Activist is the
first step.

Senator Bingaman, Democrats, Introduce Centrist Energy Bill

Senator Jeff Bingaman (NM), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee and Chair of the Alliance to Save Energy,
introduced comprehensive legislation to shape the nation's energy policy.
``If we want to tackle [our energy] problem[s] head-on, we need a
comprehensive plan that commits to increasing domestic production and to
using energy more efficiently throughout the economy.  I believe this
legislation sets out that plan," Bingaman said.

Secretary Abraham Looks for Energy in Wrong Places

Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, addressing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
noted:  =01&America faces a major energy supply crisis over the next two
decades.=018  But Abraham, like President Bush, is looking mainly to increa=
se
our supply of oil, coal, and natural gas, rather than approach both the
supply and demand sides of the issue.  Secretary Abraham mentioned energy
efficiency only once in his entire speech, even though a reduction in deman=
d
is the quickest, cleanest, cheapest (and most reliable!) energy source at
our disposal.

Democratic Task Force Weighs in on Bush Budget

Last week, House Democrats threw their hat into the ring as the Democratic
Caucus Energy Task Force held a news conference decrying Bush Administratio=
n
intentions to cut energy research significantly in their FY 2002 budget.
The Alliance is quoted in their report, which emphasizes the role of
research and development in providing long-term energy solutions.

Senate Hearing Examines Energy-Environmental Relationship

Alliance president David Nemtzow testified at a March 21 Senate Environment
Committee Subcommittee hearing on the relationship of energy policies and
environmental policies.  Nemtzow pointed out that energy efficiency is now
our nation=01,s second largest energy source.  He also offered a series of
recommendations for the Senators simultaneously to promote energy and
environmental goals.

IPCC: Energy Efficiency is Key in Mitigating Climate Change

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the third and
final volume of its Third Assessment Report on climate change, which
examines climate change mitigation strategies and places a heavy emphasis o=
n
using energy wisely. The report finds that energy efficiency for buildings,
transportation, and industry could account for more than half of the
potential greenhouse gas reductions achievable by 2020. Natural gas
technologies, more efficient power plant technologies, and combined heat an=
d
power play an important role in reducing fossil energy power plant
emissions. And "low-carbon energy systems," such as renewable energy, can
also make an important contribution. Perhaps equally important is the
finding that there is "no single path to a low emission future."

Barriers to Energy Efficiency In Public, Private Organizations

There is a gap between the opportunities for cost-effective energy-
efficiency investment identified in energy models and the levels actually
seen in practice, according to SPRU, a science and technology policy
research group in England. The origins of the gap are claimed to lie in a
series of barriers, such as lack of capital, lack of information or hidden
costs, which prevent markets for energy and energy-using technologies from
operating efficiently.  SPRU says that understanding the size and nature of
this gap is essential if policies to mitigate climate change through
improved energy efficiency are to be successful. These policies must succee=
d
in the context of liberalizing energy markets and increasing interest in th=
e
development of a broadly based energy service industry.

Dallas Cleans the Air with the IECC Energy Code

The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) voted this month to
adopt the 2000 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) for the Dallas
region.  This area accounts for almost 50,000 housing starts a year, more
than are built in 42 states.  One of the main reasons for adopting the code
is the area's commitment to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as part of the
Texas state plan for controlling smog.  Since the IECC contains a new
standard for reducing window solar heat gain, which reduces air conditionin=
g
energy use substantially, it cuts NOx emissions from the power plants that
serve the air conditioning load.  The Alliance supported Public Citizen, th=
e
Texas Building Energy Institute, the Sustainable Living Alliance, NCTCOG
staff, and others in this effort, working with the Building Codes Assistanc=
e
Project and Alliance Associates.

Energy Efficiency Facts Even Children Can Understand

A vacant house at 55 Fahrenheit uses more energy for heating than an
occupied one at 68 Fahrenheit, according to GPU Energy.  The activity in an
occupied house radiates a certain amount of heat and some of the energy
users in your home are still operating while you areaway. Designed
specifically for teachers and students, the GPU website features

To:  Bruce LaBoon, Steve Miller, Charles Duncan, Ken Lay, Steve
Letbetter, Dan Smith, Kelly Frels, Ed Galante, Jim Edmonds, Jim Kollaer

The purpose of this email is to provide additional detail to follow up on
the phone call each of you received on Friday, checking availability for
dinner with Congressman DeLay and others on Friday, April 6th.

BACKGROUND  During the last week of February, BCCA and Partnership leaders
met separately with Congressman DeLay, Congressman Joe Barton and with two
top staff members of Mr. DeLay, in order to update them on our extensive
activities aimed at federal Clean Air Act compliance.  Pursuant to those
meetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be
held in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area
on
that day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman
of the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House
Committee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has
oversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and
interaction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.

APRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's
congressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local
officials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship
channel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.
We are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.

He has asked to end the day with a "small dinner with CEOs" to have a frank
discussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called
your office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he
and the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in
addressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we
also invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.
DeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will
obviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and
advise
on strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in
attendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in
advance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before
or
after the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.

RSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim
Edmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan
and Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan
Smith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.
We will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies
to
attend the dinner.

My current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and
to arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at
a
board member's home nearby.

I trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the
Partnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with
any questions you may have.  Thank you.

Hi Mr. Reed -

I left a message on Thursday evening for Rosemarie, but was out Friday, so 
was too busy to follow up today, but having said all that, Ken Lay wanted me 
to let you know that he would like to have the TFA board meeting at the Enron 
building.  Please let me know if that will be possible.

Subject: GOOD NEWS!...and TFA Board meeting


Gentlemen,

Technology For All (TFA)received today our 501(c)(3) exemption letter
from the IRS.  This letter gives us the opportunity to vigorously
pursue new funding opportunities and also validates what we have known
all along. TFA is a charitable organization serving the underserved in
communities across the US.

We thank Jack Clark, our general counsel, for his arduous pro-bono
legal work over the past 15 months that helped make this happen.
THANKS JACK!!!

On another note, each of you should have received word from Rosemarie
Foster, TFA's Administrative Assistant, regarding a Technology For All
Board meeting scheduled for Tuesday, May 8, 2001 at the University
Hilton on the University of Houston Campus.  The meeting will take
place at 2:00 PM and conclude by 3:30 PM.  It will take place in the
context of an all-day Technology For All sponsored conference "Digital
Divide: A Call to Action".  Each of you will receive an complimentary
invitation to the activities of the day.  Ken Lay will be hosting a
CEO breakfast at 8:00 am.  Our purpose there will be to tell the TFA
story and invite the CEO's present to make a commitment to help TFA
eliminate the digital divide across Houston and beyond.  At lunch,
Greg Priest, CEO of SmartForce, will be speaking. SmartForce recently
gave TFA access to all its online eLearning content.  This gift will
allow TFA to provide workforce training opportunities to half a
million persons over the next three years.  We will thank SmartForce
during the luncheon for their enormous gift which has a retail value
that could be as high as nine figures (depending on the number of
courses utilized).

Regards,

Will

Dear Ken,

We regret that your schedule did not permit you to visit with us this week
to discuss the Center's Global Change Program.  We do understand that the
White House probably has priority.

Rosalee indicated that you are available to meet at the Center on May 24th.
the day before the Board of Trustees meeting.  May I suggest that we invite
some members of the Steering Committee to join us on the 24th to review
where we are, the political environment, and continued Center involvement
in this program area.  As you are aware we have had discussions with the
Turner Foundation on a Leadership Forum and have developed several projects
which have each received partial funding commitments from the federal
government or private foundations.    Paul O'Neill, Tim Wirth, Bill Miller,
Teresa Heinz and Michael Oppenheimer are my suggestion of Steering
Committee members to join us.  Please give me your thoughts.

As always, Mary Hope

Western State Power Forum: May 22 and May 23

Plans are proceeding nicely for the Western State Forum on May 22 and May
23.  We have an outstanding group of confirmed speakers and panelists
including many individuals that I assume you know as colleagues and friends.
I will be sending you more information on the Forum in the next few days. I
am going to send you the preliminary agenda  this morning.

You will be speaking at a critical time in the Forum; that is, just after
panels on power problems and polices and just before the final session
linking power and energy strategies to environmental objectives. It would be
great if your talk to the participants in the Forum could help them see the
relationship between power and energy related objectives and environmental
issues including GHG emissions. You should feel free however to focus your
talk in a manner of your choosing. Again, I will send you the prelim. agenda
soon.  Could you send me a title however for the final agenda's purposes?
We hope to print the final agenda later this week.    Thank you.

Mr. Lay,
?
Your assistant contacted me a couple weeks back with the message that the  
attached was not an opportunity you could consider at this time.? Thanks  
very much, though, for taking a look at it.
?
I have one follow-up question for you -- could you recommend another Enron  
executive that might be a candidate for such an opportunity?? 
?
To help you answer the question, the company is Juno Online?Services,  
Inc.?(NASDAQ: JWEB), a leading US ISP.? Juno is very interested in  working 
with (and in advanced-stage discussions with) companies in the energy  
industry and working with them on strategic telecommunications and marketing  
partnerships.
?
Information about Juno is available at "About Juno" on Juno's Web site 
http://www.juno.com.? I've also attached an  executive summary to update you 
(or the relevant person at Enron) as to the  current status of Juno's 
business.
?
Thanks very much for your assistance, and I hope that this message finds  you 
well.
?
Best,
?
Toby
?
Executive Overview of?Juno --

The company finished 4Q00 w/ $56MM in cash.? Total net loss for 2001  was 
projected to be $10-$25MM, as the company focuses on billable services,  
continues to reduce expenses, and looks to develop advertising and other  
ancillary revenue streams.? The company is confident that it can meet  
or?beat the loss target and made explicit statements that on-hand cash  
resources are "more than adequate" to get the business profitable.? The  
company has not publicly given a time-line for profitability to maintain  
flexibility.  
The company controls one of the largest dialup subscriber audiences (4MM  
active subscribers as of 4Q00, 850K of whom are billable) on the Internet  
today and is the 4th largest US ISP (after AOL, ELNK, and MSN).  
2000 revenue came in at $114MM, 65% of which was derived from subscription  
fees and 35% from advertising.? 2001 revenues are expected to come in  
between $100MM-$120MM, with the revenue mix moving toward 80% subscription 
and  20% advertising due to increased focus on billable services and the 
soft  Internet advertising markets.  
Juno has announced broadband agreements for its Juno Express product  
covering all mainstream broadband transport platforms -- AT&T Broadband,  
Time Warner Cable, and Comcast (cable); Covad (DSL); Hughes (satellite); and  
Metricom (wireless).  
The company has announced wireless distribution agreements for it's Juno  
Mobile product with Palm and Sprint PCS.? Other agreements are likely to  be 
forthcoming.  
The company has powerful propietary technology assets that give it a  
competitive advantage.? The company has launched (internally but not  
publicly) a new business unit -- Juno Solutions -- to investigate the  
opportunity to license these technology assets to third parties both  
domestically and internationally.?  
The Juno Virtual Supercomputer Project represents another example of  Juno's 
efforts to develop ancillary revenue streams.? This distributed  computing 
initiative aims to leverage unused computer processing power from  Juno's MMs 
of subscribers, aggregating it for sale to biotech, pharmaceutical,  and 
computational chemistry firms.?

Subject: Final Draft -- SEC Report on Valuation


  Attached please find the final draft.  Tim Koller and I hope
it reflects all the changes suggested on the last conference call.  Of
course, we will never be able to satisfy everyone to the last detail, but I
think we came as close as we will get.

  There is still some proof reading and minor editing to do,
and we are working on that even as we send this off.

  To the best of my knowledge there may now be two "individual
views"  to go into what is now Attachment D.  Len Baker may feel that the
language on Safe Harbor doesn't go far enough.  Baruch Lev feels that the
SEC should not only issue a "concept release" to solicit broad public
comments on a "supplementary framework for reporting intangibles," but it
should create a task force to do the work.  (Most of the group feels this
approach is too close to asking the SEC to mandate change.)  Baruch also
feels that in relying so much on voluntary disclosure, we are exaggerating
what companies will, in fact, disclose. My suggestion, Len and Baruch, is to
write a paragraph or two for Attachment D, if you wish.  Hopefully, both of
you will begin with a sentence supporting the report in general, but if you
feel strongly that the report doesn't reflect all your views, please do
state them for the record.

  Before we schedule a final call for last minute details,
etc,  I'd like to request an e-mail, fax or phone call from each of you
letting me know if you can sign-off on the report.  I'd appreciate this by
Monday, April 16th.

  Thanks a million.

  Best regards,
  Jeff

Subject: RE: for Rosalee - re Mr. Lay's participation at IEA ministerial


Dear Rosalee,

 I would again like to thank Mr Lay for agreeing to take part in both
our IEA ministerial session and in the OECD Forum 2001 - Sustainable
Development and the New Economy.  As discussed, he is to chair the first of
two energy panels at the FORUM; his is titled "Fuelling Sustainable
Development".  On his panel will be Mr Kurt Yeager of EPRI (speaking on
hydrocarbon issues), Mr Luis Echavarri, the head of the OECD's Nuclear
Energy Agency (speaking on nuclear power), and Danish Minister of Energy and
Environment, Svend Auken (speaking on renewables and energy efficiency).
The panel is scheduled to take place starting at 3pm at the Cit, des
Sciences et de l'Industrie, in La Villete, in northern Paris.

As I believe I noted in our previous e-mail communications, while the IEA is
responsible for organising our ministerial session and the substantive
issues related to the energy panels on the FORUM, the OECD is doing the
FORUM logistics.  They have therefore asked that I forward to all speakers
the following note (see below). It asks that Mr Lay provide a number of
logistical inputs, including a biography and photo, as well as information
on any remarks he might choose to make. I note that as the chair of the
first energy panel, he may not wish to make a formal presentation -- but
time does permit this if he wishes, and the decision is at his discretion.
I would appreciate being a cc on any material you send to the OECD so we can
keep our files current.

On our own side, the IEA concluded its Governing Board Meeting last Friday,
and finally approved the ministerial session agenda and arrangements.  While
Mr Priddle will be sending out a formal invitation and set of background
documents to Mr Lay this week, I wanted to give you a heads up and find out
if you had any "last-minute" questions which I might help answer.

In addition, I note that your last e-mail indicated Mrs Lay will be in Paris
during our session.  Some of our ministerial representatives are also
planning to bring spouses (in particular US Energy Secretary Abraham, who is
coming with his wife) -- do you think Mrs Lay might wish to participate in
any events during this period with any of these others?  If you let us know,
we would be happy to make arrangements.

Also, please let us know if others will be travelling with Mr Lay, and if we
might facilitate their logistics.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,

Jonathan Pershing

Subject: CONFIDENTIAL:  HR Committee Approval Requested for Option Grant


In light of Jesse Greene's acceptance of the SVP, Strategy position, we have
re-examined his option opportunity for 2001.  As you recall, we deferred a
decision on his option grant in December 2000 pending a decision on his
status.

Now that Jesse has accepted this new role, we are recommending a grant of
125,000 stock options, which is comparable to the December 2000 grant to
other 16b officers in staff positions.  As a point of reference, below are
the option grants made to 16b officers in December 2000:

Blackmore - 375k
Winkler - 350k
Larson - 275k
McDowell - 250k
Elias - 150k
Jackson - 175k
Siekman - 155k
Napier - 155k
Fox - 125k
Milton - 100k
Clarke - 75k (received additional grant of 175k options upon appointment to
CFO)
Walker - 60k (received 250k new hire options in September)
Robison - 0 (recently received new hire grant)

If you have any questions or concerns about this proposal, please let Yvonne
or I know.  If it is acceptable, please advise and we will provide a
unanimous consent for your signature to formalize.  Thank you!

Well, I know this is terribly short notice, but Ken does have a meeting with 
Tom DeLay on Monday morning at 9:30 a.m.  (I know that's half a day gone for 
Joe if he's in town), but he is coming in to discuss RMIC (Republican 
Majority Issues Committee).  Are there specific things that Ken needs to be 
briefed on?  I know that Steve did recommend that Ken have this meeting.

Thanks very much.

Rosie
Beau, Ken would like to do this if we can arrange it.  He has a video to 
receive the United Way Kneebone Award from Gerald Smith at 2:30 on Monday, 
May 7.  I'm thinking that maybe we could do this video at 2:00 p.m.  That is 
a lot to do two videos back to back, I guess, but there is very limited time 
available and I think the United Way one will be pretty easy.  Will 30 
minutes be sufficient?

Dear Stuart:

I appreciate the e-mail concerning the Board of Trustees for The Institute 
for Advanced Study in Musical Theatre.  You do indeed have a very impressive 
board. 

I am still thinking about the possibility of serving on your board.  But at 
the earliest, it would be late this year before I could entertain any 
involvement.  With your indulgence, I will keep you advised.

Warm regards,

Ken

Dear Ken:

The Institute for Advanced Study in Musical Theatre (IASMT) Board of
Trustees is presently constituted as follows:

Jerry Bock
Edgar M. Bronfman
Schuyler Chapin
Leo Linbeck III
Carlisle Floyd
Stuart Ostrow
William Safire
Stephen Sondheim

I pray you have thought happily about joining us, now that we are embarked
on a great journey into the unknown.   It was G.K. Chesterton who expressed
so eloquently the purpose of art and religion - "to remind us that we've
forgotten who we are."   (If only once a year, with six months advance
notice.)

Eagerly,

Stuart

Dear Ken,

We regret that your schedule did not permit you to visit with us this week
to discuss the Center's Global Change Program.  We do understand that the
White House probably has priority.

Rosalee indicated that you are available to meet at the Center on May 24th.
the day before the Board of Trustees meeting.  May I suggest that we invite
some members of the Steering Committee to join us on the 24th to review
where we are, the political environment, and continued Center involvement
in this program area.  As you are aware we have had discussions with the
Turner Foundation on a Leadership Forum and have developed several projects
which have each received partial funding commitments from the federal
government or private foundations.    Paul O'Neill, Tim Wirth, Bill Miller,
Teresa Heinz and Michael Oppenheimer are my suggestion of Steering
Committee members to join us.  Please give me your thoughts.

As always, Mary Hope

Subject: Gerald Smith

Over the past few months, Enron Global Finance has been evaluating various 
opportunities where Enron and Smith Graham & Company may be able to work 
together.  Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at 
Smith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since 
reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a 
proposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan 
portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this 
money ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with 
Smith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about 
$235 million.)

The proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its 
quarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the 
Committiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation 
to minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is 
looking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be 
reached sometime in May.  We have not communicated the specific details of 
our intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.

I am available for further discussion at your convenience.

Regards,
Tim DeSpain

natural gas production and oil production in the State.  He also would like 
facts about electricity transmission and any copies of articles about the 
subject.

Thanks.

Dear Colette:

 In response to your e-mail concerning the upcoming New Delhi World Forum, I 
would expect that this forum should evaluate the impact of what is happening 
on our project at Dabohl with reference to enticing other foreign 
investment.  As you probably know, the State of Maharastra has been slow 
paying and no paying for the electricity from our plant at Dabohl for 
sometime and more recently both the State of Maharastra  and the Government 
of India have refused to honor their government guarantees on this project.  
We have filed a political force majeure on the project and indeed will be 
moving into arbitration on that and a number of other issues in London in the 
not too distant future.  Again, I believe this will send a very negative 
signal to the market place as to the advisability of international companies 
investing in India.  I would think you might want to build one panel around 
this subject.  

 If there's any way we can be of help, let me know.

Best regards,

Ken Lay

Subject: India Economic Summit 2001, New Delhi 2-4 December


To the attention of:
Dr Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman
Enron


Dear Dr Lay,

When the Minister of Finance of India Yashwant Sinha recently presented the
2001-2002 national budget, it was widely acknowledged as a very ambitious
"dream budget" which puts India on a high growth trajectory. Most key
sectors should benefit from these reforms, which will thus give a new boost
to the country's economic and social progress. As such, the budget was
welcomed with great enthusiasm by the Indian and international business
community.

On the occasion of our India Economic Summit 2001 to be held in partnership
with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) from 2 to 4 December in New
Delhi, it will be the perfect time to assess the progress of the bold and
extensive measures proposed in the recent budget, how they have been
implemented and how they have impacted the business environment, domestic
industry activity and foreign investment.

As we will soon be preparing the preliminary programme of the Summit, I
would like to take the opportunity to benefit from your expertise and
understanding of the country. I would greatly appreciate receiving from you
any particular topics or issues that you wish to see given priority on the
agenda. Any suggestions of relevant speakers or experts that you may have
would also be welcomed.

I look forward to receiving your response at the above e-mail address and
kindly ask you to copy my colleague Mitra Khoubrou (e-mail:
mitra.khoubrou@weforum.org).

For more information on the 2001-2002 Union Budget, please visit the
website of the Ministry of Finance of India at http://finmin.nic.in/fub.htm

I look forward to hearing from you and hope that you will be with us in
India again next December.

Best regards,

Colette Mathur,
Director,
Center for Regional Strategies
World Economic Forum

Good morning, Mike.  What time is the meeting?

Subject: EGM - all company meeting

Ken,

Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the 
Hyatt Regency.  The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for 
an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within 
EGM.  This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we 
expect about 500 people.  

We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of 
these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have 
come in a few months.  

I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.  We had 
a record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin.  That was 50% of what they 
made in all of 2000.  Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone 
we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact.

If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way 
in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now 
core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.

Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information 
or assistance.

Mike

 The Galleo mobile multimedia communicator looks very interesting.  As you

necessarily need to add one more.  But I do appreciate you thinking of me.

Rosalee -- I just wanted to follow up to see if there are any further
questions you (or Mr Lay) have had with regard to the OECD FORUM and IEA
Ministerial sessions scheduled for 15-16 May here in Paris.  The schedule is
as I sent it to you in April -- although there may be some changes with the
events at the Ministerial dinner.  Here, while we are still intending that
Mr. Lay provide a summary of the FORUM session to the ministerial
participants, we may need to re-order the dinner agenda slightly to
accommodate Secretary Abraham's schedule.  We will keep you posted.

I would also appreciate receiving a copy of the CV that you sent to the OECD
for our own files; we are trying to compile a full set of all participants
for use during the sessions.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,

Jonathan Pershing

Oh, Gabriella (that is such a pretty name!) -

I apologize for not responding.  The conference details have been a bit 
confusing to us as we didn't seem to have many.  Mr. Lay is scheduled to 
participate in a Ministerial Working Dinner the evening of May 15.  He has to 
give a brief report on his forum session from earlier in the afternoon.  It 
is being held at the Kleber International Conference Centre.  Therefore, Dr. 
and Mrs. Lay will not be able to attend.

Thank you.

Subject: Jeff Skilling does MS150




	

Well, the bike is inspected, a few training rides have been made, and the 
camping gear is being dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the 
fairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, 
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff 
Skilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS.

Enron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over 
350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the 
Enron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am 
challenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain 
amount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a 
break on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's 
closer to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat 
pledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge 
to this very worthy cause 1-1.

I hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top 
money raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your 
consideration.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.

I just wanted to follow up to make sure that all the arrangements for Mr

the materials for the FORUM, including the VIP pass for his car and driver
made it to you.  Please let me know if not, and I will arrange to have the
materials left at his hotel pending his arrival.

I have been in touch with Mr Bradley on input to Mr Lay's remarks, and all
seems in order on that front.

Thanks again for your help.

Mr. Lay said that he would like for you to accept service on his behalf.

Subject: Re: Lawsuit


Gentlemen;

You may or may not be aware, but each of you has been named as a defendant
in a lawsuit.  The lawsuit has been filed by a Plaintiff who is represented
by one of the law firms which has filed suit against i2 in the class action
lawsuit (i.e. the Nike situation).  The Plaintiff in this lawsuit is a
nominal shareholder and acts as a front for the Plaintiff law firm.

What makes the lawsuit different from the class action is that it is a
shareholder derivative lawsuit.  What this means is that the plaintiff
shareholder has filed the lawsuit against each of you to collect damages on
behalf of i2.  The claim is based on the Nike facts, but the Plaintiff is
claiming i2 has been damaged by your actions.   What is interesting is that
all damages recovered would go to i2.  So why the lawsuit?  The Plaintiff
can recover for all legal fees he incurs in bringing the lawsuit.
Derivative actions commonly follow class action filings, as a sort of
"tag-along" type of action.

The Plaintiff attorney has requested that i2 accept service of the lawsuit
on your behalf.  Normally, I would say no and let the Plaintiff law firm
try and track you down, but they may try and serve you at an inappropriate
time, i.e. client meeting, during a speech.  Please let me know if you
would like for us to accept service on your behalf.  This is very common
practice.

I will send each of you a copy of the lawsuit.  Needless to say, you are
indemnified for this, i2 will pay for all legal fees incurred to defend you
and i2 does have insurance to cover this matter.

Please let me know of your decision to have i2 accept service on your
behalf.

Thanks

Dear Ken:

Night before last I visited with President and Mrs. Bush and suggested that he
give you a call regarding TFA (Technology For All)! I told him that it might
prove valuable for his son's campaign!  When we spoke with Cynthia Sandherr in
Washington a week or so ago, she said that the "Digital Divide" was the 
hottest
topic on Capital Hill.  She had some wonderful ideas on how to spin this so 
that
businesses create the bridge for the divide and not government!  Although we
want to stay nonpartisan with TFA, this would be a wonderful press opportunity
and platform in Washington!

Just thought I should give you "heads-up" in case he asks and please tell 
Linda
I said hello!

Thank you for doing so much for the cause!

Hi Corey -

I had tickets to Mark McGuire's team for May 12, but it is the Cinncinatti 
Reds!!!  I am so sorry.  Is that going to be o.k.?  That's  what I get for

Liz, I have sent an e-mail to our Washington office to ask for assistance in 
obtaining hotel reservations and credentials.  We don't yet have reservations 
for Ken as everything is locked up by the Republicans, but I have been 
assured they will be forthcoming.  We asked for the same hotel as your Dad

Hi Mr. Garten and Valerie -

We have been working on Ken's schedule.  It is a fairly busy week, but it 
looks like he could do a 30 minute conference call on Wed. at 2:30 p.m. (New 
York time), if that is still good for you.  Please let me know if Wednesday 
is a satisfactory time for the phone call.  That appears to be the only 
window he has next week.

Valerie had already sent the SEC Panel Outline on 4/11, which you attached 
below.  Ken Lay has already seen it.

Re:  the other question that you asked about Ken Lay's name appearing in a 
press release, he said that is fine.

Dear Ken,

We are in the process of trying to arrange a conference call with you on
either Tuesday or Wednesday of next week to discuss the paper which is
attached.  ( I'm sending it along now so that you have some time to look at
it.)

We will be doing this by conference call and once we set a time to talk with
you, will give you the number to call.  (To set up a time, your office can
contact my assistant, Valerie Petersen either at valerie.petersen@yale.edu
or at 203-432-6035.)

Look forward to speaking with you next week.

Best regards,

Dear Mr. Misaki:

Dr. Lay would prefer that the pre-meeting continue to be scheduled at 8:30 
a.m. on January 29, as he has conflicts the afternoon of January 28, so it 
would be difficult for him to attend.

Please advise.

World Economic Forum-Mr. Nishimuro's Notes
"What should be the environmental agenda for business in the 21st
century?"

.Introduction
1. Awareness of Environmental Issue
1)   Environmental issue, like Global warming, Excessive use of
natural resources, Recycling, Pollution, is of major significance.
The impact on the business is becoming to increase.
2)   The Kyoto Conference(COP3) defined an international framework
for dealing with the issue of global warming.
(The GHG reduction targets contained in the Kyoto Protocol are 6%
for Japan, 7% for the U.S.A., 8% for the EU)
Specific content for the Flexibility Mechanism/Kyoto Mechanism
(for International Emissions Trading (IET), Joint Implement (JI),
and Clean Development Mechanism(CDM)) will be decided on at COP6,
which is scheduled for November 2000.
     GHG is a serious matter requiring a globally studying.

2. GHG Reduction
1)   The relationship between GHG levels and climatic change
remains uncertain at present and further research is required.
Policies will have to be devised that take account of developments
in scientific knowledge and opinion and that also maintains
flexibility.
2)   Policy on GHG reduction must reflect the circumstances of
each country and be based on a combination of regulatory measures,
economic measures and voluntary measures.
     Excessive regulating may cause the unfairness in business
competition.

3. Energy Conservation
1)   The U.S.A. is the largest consumer of energy. In such a
large, mobile country, much
consumption is accounted for by the transportation sector.
2)   The EU has pushed many advances in environmental protection,
and has seen considerable progress in the use of renewable energy.

3)   Japan has very limited natural resources, and energy
conservation has been promoted since the oil shocks of the 1970s.
As a result, Japan is a leader in making effective use of energy,
and has the lowest level of GHG emissions against GDP.
Japan's policy is to combine regulation with voluntary measures.
Industry has supported this by promoting voluntary environmental
plans and other measures.
Japanese industries including Toshiba are to improve the energy
consumption efficiency of their products and use of energy at
their factories.

4. Programme of Industry
1)   Energy conservation is to make up the cost reduction of
products and recycling will bring about the effect on manufacturing
cost saving in the long run.

Jeff, I will definitely show this to Mr. Lay.  However, I had a thought.  Why 
don't you draft what you'd like him to say and then he can make changes to it

Subject: Cougars @ Enron

Ken,
Thank you for the opportunity to meet today at the "Enron Teaching Excellence 
Awards."  It was an indeed an honor and a privilege to finally speak to you 
in person.  Ironically, when I returned to the office today I received your 
interoffice mail concerning the below email.  I certainly understand that you 
will not be able to attend many events as I am sure that your schedule is 
quite demanding.  I believe that this group will benefit substantially by 
knowing that you are aware that it exists and want to support it.  Is it 
possible to send a brief email to UH alumni at Enron letting them know as 
such?  If the alumni see that you support our efforts, they will take an 
increased interest in participating and provide us a solid foundation with 
which to work.  Please provide me any feedback you may have.

As we talked about today, we would like to begin having occasional "brown 
bags" in an effort to get the alumni better acquainted with the university.  
I believe that we should have one with Dr. Smith to promote the image 
campaign, changes at the university, the tier 1 status, etc.  If you could 
make it that would be great but if not that is OK as well.  I will send you 
the date when I have it.

Chet Gladchuk has agreed to work with us to orchestrate a tailgate party on 
Sept. 16th to welcome Dana Dimel in his first home football game.  We will 
have a tent, food, refreshments, football tickets, etc.  I suspect that it 
will be from approx. 4:00 PM to 10:00 PM.  Please let me know if your 
calendar is free.

I am truly excited to have you as alumni and am grateful for your 
approachability.  Please let me stress that I do not expect you to make all 
or even most of our events.  I would just like to let you know what we are 
doing and if you find that you are free, we would love to have you.

Thank you for your time,
Jeff

To: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON

Subject: Cougars @ Enron

Mr. Lay,
My name is Jeff McClellan and I am President of the "Cougars @ Enron".  We 
are a group of Enron employees that are UH alumni that have banded together 
to form a chartered extension of the Houston Alumni Organization.  We had our 
kickoff event in the 50th floor dining room on March 7th of this year and 
have received substantial interest in our organization.  I wanted to drop you 
a line to tell you not only about us, but also what we are doing.  As of 
today, we have 107 employees that have expressed interest in contributing to 
our group's success. We have several stated objectives:

1. Network Enron Cougars together to build strong working relationships.  
This will benefit the employees as well as the company.
2. Raise and present scholarships to Enron dependents to attend the 
University of Houston.  This will help to ease education costs.
3. Assist the company in its recruiting efforts concerning the university.
4. Assist the university through financial gifts whenever possible.

Currently, here is what we have planned:

4/15/2000 The HAO has given us their hall at "Frontier Fiesta".   Frontier 
Fiesta is a festival thrown by the students and alumni that provides good 
family   fun. The HAO is having it catered and everyone is invited.

9/16/2000 We are throwing a tailgate party to celebrate Dana Dimel's first 
home football game against Army.  We are working with Chet Gladchuk to set up 
a   tent, have it catered, listen to a live band, football tickets, etc.  We 
would like to make this event open to all of Enron if possible.  The 
university will   provide Enron special recognition on both the Cougar Vision 
Scoreboard and over the PA in both the first and second half of the contest.

These are the confirmed events so far as we are still in the opening stages.  
We anticipate to have more events planned (golf tournament) which I would 
like the opportunity to share with you.  This group is designed to cater to 
its members, the company, and the university and I believe it is going to be 
one of the most successful out there.  To achieve such a plateau, however, we 
need to be a continuous draw to old and new alumni alike.  To have you as an 
alumni is truly a monumental draw to our employees and the university.  Would 
you consider making several appearances with us at our events?  Your 
participation would greatly increase our exposure and ability to accomplish 
our goals and we would love the chance to honor you as one of our most 
distinguished alumni.  If there are any suggestions that you may have as to 
how to further our group, I would love to hear them.  I understand that you 
are extremely busy and I do not wish to monopolize your time but this alumni 
charter is something that I truly believe in and I hope you will agree that 
it has great potential.  With you support, we can attain a level of success 
that will set us aside from any other group.

Thank you for your time,
Jeff





Dick, I don't know if we answered this for you or not, but I'm sure it will 
be fine for you to draft a letter for Ken's signature.

"Gary Hamel's 'revolutionary entrepreneurship' model represents a
substantial advance in our understanding of what companies must do to
become outstanding innovators.  It should influence not only top management
but also every employee who, indeed, is the CEO of their business life."

Subject: Meeting with SM Krishna, CM of Karanataka in Davos as per his letter 
to Dr. Lay

Dear Ken: 

As discussed I would appreciate your meeting with the CM even for a few 
minutes at Davos. I will find soem time in ur schedule to brief you for that 
meeting before you leave for Davos.

The CM considers u as a personal friend now that u have arranged for him to 
be invited to Davos. In fact he has also requested you personally whether you 
can arrange a meeting with Bill Gates while he is there. That would probably 
be impossible given everyone's schedule there and my message for that to the 
CM is going to be that eaxctly that... the schedules look impossible to 
arrange that.

However for your meeting, I would appreciate giving us some time.

Regards,
Sanjay

Dear Rosalee,

The Council meeting in Geneva will take place on 31 August-1 September. As

I hope that this preliminary information will be of help to you. If you
have any specific questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Dr. Lay,
        In my last note, I believe I promised to check on the dates for the
Faculty-Alumni Awards ceremonies in the future.  The University and the MU
Alumni Association have them scheduled for:
        October 26, 2001,
        October 4, 2002, and
        October 10, 2003.
As I mentioned, the nominations are due February 1st of each year, and
attendance at the awards ceremony is necessary in order to receive it.  The
process is competitive, but I would like to proceed with your nomination
this coming winter if the 2001 date is available on your schedule.
        I visited with Mr. Purdy yesterday about a project at the Evans

        I look forward to visiting with you again.  Until then, I am

RE:??? June 14 Reception 

Recently Charles Miller and David Dewhurst sent you an invitation 
to a reception which they are hosting on Wed. 6/14 at 5:00 PM to be 
held at the Houston Petroleum Club. 

I hope that you will be able to attend that event. 

Under the leadership of Governor Bush and others we have made real progress 
in Education in Texas over the past decade.? Now it is time to take 
the next steps and achieve even greater progress in our public education 
system. 

The Texas Education Reform Caucus is made up of business leaders, educators, 
and elected officials dedicated to finding common sense approaches to 
improving 
education in Texas. 

I would appreciate the opportunity to visit with you on the 14th.

Hi -

Just to let you know that it looks like one day will work.  I want to check 
with Mr. Lay before confirming.

Thanks.

Subject: Meeting with Arthur Levitt in September


 Dear Ken,

 As you know, our next meeting is on Wednesday, July 12 from
3:00-5:30 p.m.  In the next week or so, we'll be sending around a discussion
paper which we hope crystallizes the issues, and we will try to talk to as
many of you as possible before the meeting to go through it.

 Meanwhile, Arthur Levitt has agreed to meet with us in September to
brainstorm on the ideas we've generated and also to give us a sense of some
of the issues as he sees them.  There are three possible dates for the
meeting, which I suggest be in two parts -- first, a meeting among the panel
only from 5:00-6:30 p.m., and then a dinner with Chairman Levitt from
6:30-8:30 p.m.  Here are the dates:

 Could you please let us know which of these would be possible for
you:


  ___________ Thursday, September 14  5:00-8:30 pm

  ___________ Monday, September 25  5:00-8:30 pm

  ___________ Wednesday, September 27 5:00-8:30 pm



 Many thanks,
 Jeff Garten

Hello Janice:

 I enjoyed your recent e-mail but was sorry to hear about your dad.  It 
sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly.  These are always 
difficult times.  As I watched my mother and father's health deteriorate and 
ultimately watched them die, it is a very defining time in our lives.  But we 
can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege 
to have been raised in such loving homes.

 Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU.  He is joining an 
excellent company.  I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his 
education working toward an MBA.  As we are living in an age where 
intellectual capital is so valuable, it is important for every young person 
to obtain the very best possible education they can.  As to our family, 
within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a 
young man from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They met while they were both 
working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires.  They're currently on their 
honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to 
Miami, Florida.  This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born.  It 
was born to our son David and his wife Courtney.  It was a 7 lb., 10 oz.,  20 
inch little boy.  So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters 
ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days.  They are a great 
deal of fun.  We are doing quite well.  I am looking forward to seeing Ginger 
"Rees" Copeland when she comes to Houston.  I would be delighted to arrange 
tickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit 
Houston.

 I hope you have a great summer.
Dear Mr. Carmona -

Everything you have is correct.  I don't have an exact arrival time on July 
28 at this point.

Hi Liz -

Will you please give your Dad a call at the office at your earliest 
convenience.

Rosie
As we discussed, the date that Ken thinks is best for the United Way Kick-off 
is August 9 at the conclusion of the Employee Meeting.  He thinks it would be 
fine to do the presentations there and then move on to whatever activity is 
planned.

Thanks for everyone's patience.

Hi Donna -

Ken said that the letter is fine.  Do you want to send us a list of the past 
Fathers and let us send the letters?

Let me know.

Subject: Solicitation to Past Fathers of the Year


Ken,
  Thank you so very much for thinking of this idea.  It is so timely and
certainly fits with Kirbyjon's challenge. I have spoken with Hardie (who
also edited this letter for me) and we both agree that this would have much
greater impact if it came directly from you, as a past Father of the Year.
As you can see we attributed the information about our shortfall directly
to me, so I am involved in the letter but not doing the solicitation.  If
you are not comfortable with this, just let me know and I will redo the
letter.  I think if you agree to send this out over your signature it would
be enormously helpful.  Please let me know what you'd like me to do.

  Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and continuous support.

Linda, before we knew that you and Ken were going to the VIP reception, Ken 
had me ask if others could attend in your place.  I did ask and they have 
just called me that Nancy Kinder said that it is o.k. for the Vermeils and 
the Herrolds to attend, in addition to you and Ken.  They did ask if we would 
not spread it around as others have asked and they have not let them.

Oh, but Beau just called that Heather is ill and they are cancelling.

Dear Mr. Lay,

As you are no doubt aware your colleague Jeffrey Skilling  recently made a=

success of that event, I would like to invite you to make the  keynote=20
address at Energy & Power Risk Management  Conferences=01, third annual=20
information technology event as  outlined above. This year's keynote sessio=
n=20
is entitled "The E-Commerce Revolution: Innovations and  opportunity in the=
=20
electronic energy marketplace". This session has no  bullet points as I wou=
ld=20
like the speaker to address only the latest issues as  they see fit. My=20
research has showed that the industry is very interested in  your opinions =
on=20
this subject and I hope you can fit this hour-long session into  you busy=

schedule.

=01+Information Technology=01, will take a focused look  at the latest adva=
nces=20
being made in the energy market=01,s systems and  technologies. The confere=
nce=20
will be structured in two streams, offering  delegates and speakers the=20
chance to tailor the event to their own areas of  interest. The streams wil=
l=20
be partitioned into five areas:=20

1) Information technology for risk management

2) Information technology for pricing and trading

3) Data techniques and strategies

4) Advanced technologies for trading and risk management

5) Challenges of the evolving energy marketplace

Each of these categories will investigate the kind of problems  being faced=
=20
by energy IT/IS managers, traders and risk managers alike. I have  attached=
 a=20
copy of the program for your information. There will also be a  software=20
exhibition at the conference at which vendors will be demonstrating  their=
=20
products, as well as a post-conference seminar on data management.

This conference will be of the highly technical level that  people have com=
e=20
to expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage  participation=
=20
from speakers in modifying the program to suit the audience and  issues at=

hand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please  let=

me know; any help would be gratefully received.

This event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy  & Power Risk=20
Management Magazine and our extensive database. It is my aim to  attract th=
e=20
leading market players by providing a first-class program with  top-rated=
=20
speakers, making this a highly worthwhile event for the energy  industry.

Unfortunately my schedule for this program is very tight. I  would greatly=

Hi Liz -

The reason Ken and Linda were trying to reach you from the plane was that 
they had some suggestions for the hotel rooms and wanted you to know their 
preference.  They would like to give the Jasmine Suite that they are 
currently in to the Vittors with a connecting bedroom, to take care of their 
family.

They would like Mark and Natalie to have the end or corner suite that the 
Vittors have.

Ken and Linda said that they would prefer two connecting rooms, hopefully on 
the 3rd or 4th floor.  They would like for the rooms to have the ocean view 
on the North side.  If that isn't possible, it would be o.k. to overlook the 
pool, but they would not really like the south side as it wouldn't be as 
quiet.  The two rooms would give them everything they need, with 2 baths.

They said they can be reached in Switzerland tomorrow.  The Hotel Meierhof's 
phone number is:  41-81-416-82-85, Fax is:  41-81-416-39-82.  They should 
arrive in Davos about 9:00 a.m.

I know you will have a beautiful and wonderful wedding!!  Thank you so much 
for including me on the Save the Date list.  I feel honored!  Unfortunately, 
we won't be able to come.   Our "first" anniversary is June 3, but was 1961!!

Take care and call if we can do anything.

Dear Kenneth,

 Hello! I wanted to inform you of an exclusive Delphi Event.  Attached is a 
letter from Tom Koulopoulos, The Delphi Group's CEO, explaining the details 
for our upcoming Executive Retreat to be held on August 28-29 in Aspen. This 
is going to be a truly unique experience.

 I would like to extend you and other senior level executives at Enron an 
invitation to this  event. I have already invited George Short. This event is 
limited attendance since the St. Regis Aspen can only accommodate 200. The 
early registration fee is $2500.00 per seat.

 I will follow up with you later in the week. In the meantime, if you have 
any questions, please e-mail or call me at 617-247-1511.

Best Regards,

Subject: 2nd Annual Enron/MDA Beach Bowl


Hello, Mr. Lay! Enron and MDA are joining together again to do a 2nd Annual 
Beach Bowl to raise money for MDA. Last year, the event was a great success, 
raising over $70,000.  This year's goal is to raise $100,000, so the 
fundraising benchmarks for all teams have been raised. The money raised will 
be used to further research for ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).

I have put together a team of Analyst interns (Howard Goldfarb, Rachel 
McPhaul, Nicole Brady, Bradley Aiken and myself) for a second year to help in 
this cause.  The benchmark for the team is the raise $600 (pre-matching), but 
I want to outdo the fundraising of $1400+ (post-matching) we did last year.

I am asking for a donation to MDA to help our team bowl in this event.  
Checks are payable to MDA.

FYI, Enron matches all donations $20 or more. 

The event will take place on Saturday, July 29, 2000.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks! Have a great day!

Hi Deborah -

Ken Lay does want to meet with you re:  your earlier e-mail.  I know this 
sounds incredible, but the really best date is not until September 26!!!  His 
schedule is just not to be believed!!!  He is pretty free that day, so he 
could do an early afternoon.  Would 2:00 p.m. work for you?

Thanks.

Subject: Milken Institute Conference Sponsorship



Ken,

I hope all is going well at Enron.  I know you and/or your people have been
discussing with Glenn Yago our so-called Emerging Domestic Markets Project.
It is an exciting one and we look forward to Enron's support, involvement,
participation and leadership.  Glenn will be in touch as the project
unfolds.

Now I am contacting you about our upcoming Global Conference, March 8-10,
2000 in Los Angeles.  There are two issues.

First, I am sure you are aware, we are holding our third annual Milken
Institute Global Conference March 8-10, 2000 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in
Los Angeles. A copy of the program is attached. This year's event will have
a heavy contingent of institutional investors, corporate leaders, and
technology, media and policy people in the audience.  On the program, we
have nine Nobel Laureates, several CEOs of major corporations, and other
heavy hitters.  As you can see, there is a major technology slant to this
year's program.  It will be a great event.  We would love to have some
representation from Enron in the audience.

Second, we are still accepting corporate sponsorship for the event.  I have
attached a copy of our Sponsorship Opportunities brochure that describes the
various levels ($10K - $100K), and the benefits of each sponsorship tier.
This is a great program to be associated with - both high-quality speakers
and a prestigious audience.  Mike Milken and I hope to be able to count on
your organization for support.

We anticipate a global audience of 1,500 - senior people from the financial
sector, business, technology, academia, the policy community and all the
major media.  In just two years, our Global Conference has become a
significant and influential gathering for discussion, debate and networking
on key business, economic, financial and policy questions.

I hope we can count on you.

Dear Mr. Lay:
             My name is James Partsch-Galvan. I am the Libertarian Candidate
for Texas Rep. 147. I do not support this new Sports Arena Deal. I was on the
winning side last year, and I am galvanizing to be be on the winning side
this year.
I find it very deporable that the Sports Authority cancelled its Board
Meeting tomorrow. This is another dirty trick that the Sports Authority is
making to make it harder for citizens to voice their opinions. This is one
more reason for taxpayers to vote no for any taxpayer funds to fund a new
arena that is not needed.
Sincerely, James Partsch-Galvan

Ken:

Greetings from the GOP Convention.  I notice on my master schedule that
Enron is hosting a cocktail party on Wednesday from 5 to 7.  I was wondering
two things:

1.  Is it alright if I come by, as a member of the Advisory Committee?  And,

2.  Will I see you there?

Hope all is well and that I will see you in Philadelphia.
I am staying at the Sheraton University City as a member of the California
delegation. 215-222-2910.  I am also wearing my Blackberry for 24 x 7 real
time wireless email access.

Regards,

Bob

Ken-I have revised the term sheet provided to us by George yesterday along
the lines that you suggested to give the partners somewhat stronger rights
on the choice of seats and suites.  These rights are not as strong as the
rights the Partnership got from the Astros, but I hope they will be
considered sufficient by the partners.  I received an e-mail yesterday from
Conoco reiterating Archie's concern on the preferential rights.  So far, all
of the partners  I've heard from on the financing term sheet are OK with it.
However, I haven't yet heard from Ric Campo on the financing term sheet.

Dictated letter from Ken Lay

Dear John:

I enjoyed your recent e-mail.  I also appreciate your kind comments 
concerning our broadband activity.  The deal with Blockbuster has been a 
great deal of fun and is opening up all kinds of additional opportunities.

I enjoyed looking through the agenda for your meeting in Sweden.  It looks 
quite informative and interesting.  Sweden is also an excellent place for a 
summer conference.

The young man you refer to in your letter should send his resume to Celeste 
Roberts at (713) 853-0555.  If he would also copy me on the letter to 
Celeste, I would be happy to follow up and make sure it is carefully 
considered.

I'm delighted that your life appears to be going very well at the current 
time.  I hope our paths will again cross in Aspen or elsewhere in the not too 
distant future.

Warm regards,

Ken

Gene:

 I appreciated the update on your health status.  It appears you are taking a 
very tough situation and, with help from some of the best doctors in the 
world, setting about to turn it around.  I'm sure it goes without saying that 
you know we are all pulling for you and betting on a positive outcome.

 Clearly your health is the number one issue now.  To the extent you want to 
work and can work, we are delighted to have you back in the office.  But that 
is a very distant secondary concern until you get everything done about your 
health that can be done.  If there is any way I or Enron can be of any 
further help, please let me know.

If you are inclined to accept this invitation, we could put together an 
interesting talk on the importance of good mental health to business with 
some national statistics and then segue into Enron's emphasis on wellness and 
having fun in the workplace.  Our strategy and experience will be very 
interesting to the group since it shows what a corporate leader is doing to 
become the employer of choice in the marketplace.

You could expect a full house (around 400) for the talk.  If it fits into 
your schedule, Jack Bowen said he would be delighted to be honorary chairman 
of the event.

Ken and Jeff,

As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the 
Enron Associate program for several years now.  I also recently have become 
involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which 
provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.  They 
are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will 
include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their 
company's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to 
ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would 
really highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a "Core School" in 
the MBA recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for 
March 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.

Kevin

Kevin-


Just a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding Enron's
participation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week and the
possibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had a
chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on
you plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. 
Below is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all
is well with you.


            Nov.2 email text


We at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link
with Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the
agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable
markets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like
Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic
Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and
beyond.


The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. 
First, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key
speaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As
described in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three
conferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and
students.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a "live
case study" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,
2001</underline>.


You, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this
is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay
and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and
the Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the
corporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken
Chenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced
President of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a
distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in
continually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  


We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership
Week, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman
Sachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company
and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank
Rhodes, but these are still long shots.


The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the
Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted
a platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If
they can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the
date is March 28, 2001.       


The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same
lines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it
could become the basis for the March conference live case study
presentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to
literally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage
an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place
that you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to
be the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and
practices make this possible.


I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around
1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and
leadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to
building this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer
from the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the
Enron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast
moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient
way.


Kevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and
hopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to
make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. 
Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As
always, thanks for your great personal support.

Dear Kelly:

I appreciate your comments regarding Enron's advertising focus.  First, Enr=
on=20
become involved  with Enron Field for two reasons:  to keep the Astros in=
=20
Houston and to gain energy and facilities management business for Enron=20
Energy Services.  Acquiring the naming rights to the stadium came much late=
r=20
in our negotiations with the Astros.  In addition, while sports events like=
=20
NASCAR are exciting to watch and get a fair amount of media play,  we're=20
targeting a more specific audience with our advertising dollars.
 =20
Increasingly, Enron=01,s integrated products and services require the appro=
val=20
of an organization=01,s highest ranking officers, people who carry a =01&CX=
O=018=20
title, such as chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief=20
information officer or chief technology officer. These individuals may not=
=20
recognize Enron=01,s name and abilities as readily as energy-centric execut=
ives.

We also want to reach the elected and appointed officials who set policy an=
d=20
regulations affecting Enron businesses worldwide. The "Ask Why" advertising=
=20
campaign launched in February this year was designed with these groups in=
=20
mind as well as to put the Enron name and image on everyone=01,s radar scre=
en.=20
Enron commercials continue to appear on business channels such as CNBC and=
=20
CNNfn, as well as the History Channel, ESPN and network news programs. Some=
=20
are running in Europe as well.

While we won't rule out entirely the possibility of directing some of our=
=20
future advertising dollars toward sports events, for now, we believe we are=
=20
spending our ad budget where it will have the greatest positive impact on o=
ur=20
business.

Thanks for your suggestion.  Keep them coming.

2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation

Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges

Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took=
 a=20
step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20
designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20
monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t=
he=20
elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20
1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for=
=20
California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc=
e=20
the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20
offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o=
f=20
distributed generation.
=20
Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20
investor-owned and municipal utilities

Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =
a=20
step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20
interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=
=20
requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20
generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=
=20
interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=
=20
through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20
possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=
e=20
utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20
accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.

Permitting and Air Quality Issues
Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=
 or=20
greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=
d=20
therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20
generation faces. =20

Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru=
=20
D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=
=20
output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil=
ities.=20
In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=
=20
face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20
interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=
. =20
These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.

3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=
=20
Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20

Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=
=20
suppliers.
Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=
e=20
goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.
However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=
=20
concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.
We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=
redit=20
risk concerns.
Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=
=20
is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=
=20
both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=
=20
going forward.

Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue

Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority
The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20
charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=
=20
analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20
California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =
As=20
such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=
es=20
adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.

Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018
The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=
=20
=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=
use to=20
allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20
purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=
ee=20
to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=
=20
DWR has entered into with suppliers.
=20
Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=
=20
Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases
In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=
=20
noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=
=20
the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=
oy to=20
permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=
s=20
extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=
re=20
DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =
is=20
difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=
=20
rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=
=20
costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=
=20
suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=
=20
from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.

Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20

We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=
sk=20
issues.  We have identified three options:

Amend AB1X
The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=
=20
PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=
red by=20
DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =
to=20
ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=
=20
preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=
=20
challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20
entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)

Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20
through Contract Language
This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20
implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=
re=20
time to implement than the "legislative" fix.  We have attached electronic=
=20
copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=
=20
would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20
=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)

Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk
As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=
cept=20
other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=
=20
cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=
=20
indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=
=20
prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=
=20
contract amendments.

4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001

Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20
Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=
=20
showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=
r=20
only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=
l=20
credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=
=20
of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20
likely. =20

CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20
summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20
estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=
 well=20
below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=
n=20
in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=
=20
than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20
unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=
o=20
date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=
he=20
flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20
California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =
this=20
requirement. =20

Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=
=20
draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=
re=20
supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=
=20
number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20
utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=
t=20
pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=
=20
added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.

CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=
=20
rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20
optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=
=20
MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=
=20
should view the CEC's "rosy scenario" with considerable skepticism.

5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=
=01,s=20
Electricity Crisis

This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=
l=20
deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=
=20
bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.

As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20
crisis must focus on four issues:

Increase supply
Decrease demand
Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market
Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency

Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)
To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =
=20
Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=
=20
than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.

The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=
slation=20
are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=
se=20
efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=
=20
in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20
requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=
=20
proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20
transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20
innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20
emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=
ir=20
districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20
required reductions in pollution emissions.

Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)
Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=
=20
the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=
=20
best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=
st=20
effectively and quickly in two ways:

Buy-down demand
California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=
d=20
to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=
 more=20
economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=
ld=20
be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=
=20
through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20
determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20
participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20
necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20
reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=
eal=20
Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.

Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment
To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:

An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=
=20
for hour-ahead power in real time.=20
Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=
=20
verification.
Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=
=20
paid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).

The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=
e:

=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=
cularly=20
in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=
=20
resources.
reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20
electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =
in=20
the state.
fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=
k=20
of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20
customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=
=20
responding.=20

We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=
=20
excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=
=20
summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate=
=20
that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=
s=20
that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20
directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20
control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.

Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=
cle:=20
SB27X
The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=
re=20
customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=
=20
service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=
=20
customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=
e=20
prohibition against Direct Access.

Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=
=20
direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o=
f=20
Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from=
=20
customer migration. =20

In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=
=20
the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme=
nt=20
is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20
condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20
therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20
function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20
non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ=
ia=20
should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period =
in=20
which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments=
=20
of utility load.

Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative =
vehicle:=20
AB18X
Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand=
. =20
In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20
imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers=
=20
and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ=
ia=20
State government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend=
ed=20
period of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=
e=20
in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20
participate in that market.

California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=
=20
series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20
increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without=
=20
=01&shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California c=
ould=20
amortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year perio=
d. =20
In addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:=
=20
First, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in=20
recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of =
AB=20
1890.  Second, California can =01&net=018 the revenues the utilities have r=
eceived=20
from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav=
e=20
accrued due to the retail price cap.

We plan to distribute the final draft by mid-March in time for you to take
one last careful look before a conference call at the end of the month, and
also for you to submit any supplementary views for inclusion. My suggestion
is that views be kept to a few paragraphs, if possible. For those who wish
to write one, you could disagree with part of the report, you could suggest
a slightly different emphasis on some aspect of the report, or you could
underline some aspect that you are especially enthusiastic about and believe
deserves more attention.

When we send the next draft to you I'll try to propose something about how
we might release the report, but I would appreciate any suggestions you have
about that.

Here are two proposed dates for our next conference call. Please indicate
your availability by preference (#1, #2).

(#2) Wednesday, March 28, 5-6:30 PM
     (Eastern Standard Time)

(#1) Thursday, March 29, 5-6:30 PM
     (Eastern Standard Time)

Could you also send us the precise way that you would like your name and
title to appear in the report?

Many thanks,

Jeff Garten

Dear Mr. Lay,

     Enron's  dynamic growth in the field of energy
during the last three years is truly remarkable. As a
student of business, I am truly impressed by the
strategic acquistions made by Enron in the area of
power and its leveraged arbitrage with the gas
industry.
     I would very much like to make a career within
Dynegy and would appreciate very much if you would
consider me for a Management trainee position in your
esteemed organization. Enclosed is a copy of my

Freedom of Press 'under threat' in Russia, campaigners claim

Russia's provincial media is struggling to maintain its freedoms in the face
of politically motivated assaults, campaigners claim.

Oleg Panfilov, chief of the Centre for Journalism in Extreme Situations,
said: "A new state propaganda machine is being created in the federal
districts, with new state-run newspapers, new state-run news agencies, new
state-run TV channels."

Fyodor Penkin, chief editor of the Volga Times, who survived a shotgun
attempt on his life earlier this year, said: "Ten years ago, when I was
creating this newspaper, I felt for the first time that I can write freely.
Now this child I have created is dying before my eyes."

Media's role in Ghana's presidential election praised

Ghana's acting ambassador to the US has offered a glowing account of the
role played by his country's media in the recent presidential election.

Francis Tsegah said radio in particular played a significant part in
ensuring the success of the election - Ghana's first multi-party one.

He said:  "The press covered the parties and were able to send information
to the public in such a way that by the time you had the election there was
no longer any question of the media being biased towards one party."

The election was won by opposition candidate John Kufuor.

despaired of ever uncovering the truth about his death.

Myroslava Gongadze said her "endless moves" to find out what happened to her
husband were "na<ve".

The journalist's headless body was found near Kiev. Gongadze was a fierce

Malaysia increases pressure on media

Malaysia has increased pressure on both foreign and domestic media, by
branding people involved in award-winning news site Malaysiakini.com
"traitors" and delaying the distribution of the latest issues of Asiaweek
and the Far Eastern Economic Review (FEER).

Prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said of Malaysiakini: "People who love
Malaysia would not support Malaysiakini. Previously people would say
traitors but these people really behave like traitors, asking foreigners to
harm their own country."

Two Asiaweek issues and one of FEER - all carrying articles on Malaysia -
were stuck in distributions depots, and FEER Managing Editor Michael
Vatikiotis said: "We have no indication as to whether this is just a one off
or part of a policy. We have had no official communication."

Asiaweek is part of the AOL-Time Warner stable, and FEER part of Dow Jones.

Taiwan vows to safeguard free speech over controversial book

Taiwan's President Chen Shui-ban has vowed to safeguard the island's freedom
of speech as a row over a controversial Japanese comic book continued to
divide the state.

The book claimed that many Taiwanese women, forced to act as sex slaves to
Japanese soldiers during World War Two, were volunteers. Some politicians
demanded the cartoonist be denied a visa to visit Taiwan while others
insisted that he be allowed his freedom of speech.

BBC's Sambrook pledge to "get below the hype"

BBC News director Richard Sambrook has vowed to improve the quality of his
empire's output by better integrating its disparate parts, and "getting
below the hype".

In an interview with The Times' media editor, Ray Snoddy, Sambrook, who
officially takes the director's chair this week from the departing Tony
Hall, says he is running a "fantastic operation". But, he admits, it
"misfires slightly as we go down the road. We do not quite pack the punches
that we ought to".

Sambrook says he has discussed how best to coordinate journalists in the UK
regions, and World Service, with senior BBC executives.

Broadcasters face curbs in Singapore

Foreign broadcasters who "engage in the domestic politics of Singapore"
could soon face restrictions.

Information and Arts Minister Lee Yock Suan said he was set to introduce a
bill that would allow the government to restrict distribution of a broadcast
service if the company was deemed to be meddling in the city-state's
internal affairs.

Singapore's Newspaper Act can ban distribution of a newspaper or magazine
and has been used against The Economist and Asian Wall Street Journal, but
up until now broadcasters have been left alone.

Lee said foreign media operated in Singapore as a matter of privilege, not
of right.

He added: "Our aim is not to ban information but to restrict subscriber and
advertising revenue to an errant channel."

Australia's ABC must decentralise to lessen Sydney bias, MD says

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation must decentralise both staff and
activities to prevent it from becoming a Sydney mouthpiece, managing
director Jonathan Shier said.

Shier said that by June 2003, the ABC wanted to increase its
non-news/current affairs production in centres other than Sydney or
Melbourne by 40 percent.

He also said that the internet had its place within media and should not be
sidelined just because of the recent dot com gloom.

Unions claim that the decentralisation talk is just a "stalking horse for
getting rid of staff".

Journalist Ware reportedly offered safe house by BBC

The BBC has reportedly offered a safe house to Panorama reporter John Ware,
the journalist most closely associated with the expose on the Omagh bombing.

According to the Times newspaper, the Corporation has also offered Ware
personal protection.

The bomb blast outside the BBC's west London centre is being blamed on the
Real IRA, who may have acted in revenge over the Panorama reports.

Meanwhile, speculation that the BBC might move flagship current affairs
programme Panorama back to a weekday slot - but on BBC2 - refuses to go
away.

MediaGuardian quotes an 'insider' as saying: "Sunday may just have been a
transition. If it moved to a weekday slot, possibly even to BBC2, it would
increase its audience and get more share."

The BBC has insisted that Panorama will remain in its Sunday night slot,
despite opposition from some prominent figures, including Ware.

Indonesian copies of Time censored by distributor

The Indonesian distributor of Time Magazine censored pictures of headless
corpses -victims of the ethnic bloodshed in Indonesia's Central Kalimantan
province - in the Asian edition of the magazine, as he feared it would
incite more violence.

The front cover image and photographs inside the magazine, where decapitated
bodies were shown, were blacked out by hand in all copies being sent to
Indonesia. The distributor said it had not come under pressure from the
government to censor the pictures.

Time journalist Jason Tedjasukmana said he was concerned that the move could
lead to other companies taking censorship into their own hands.

UK broadcasters on guard against online poll rigging in Election run-up

The UK's top broadcasters have pledged to be on alert for attempts by
political activists to rig online polls in the run up the General Election.

The BBC's assistant director of news Mark Damazer told how the Corporation
had ran a poll during its Europe week coverage, only to inadvertently
receive an e-mail from a pressure group asking its supporters to '"keep
e-mailing this site, we need to get in as many votes as we can".

And ITN's editor-in-chief Richard Tait said: "We are going to be extremely
careful not to allow any online polling to be hijacked by an individual
group."

The Times loses its online editor to AOL UK

The Times has lost its web site editor. Andy Bull is joining AOL UK as
general manager and director of editorial.

Media Guardian says happy birthday to Rupert Murdoch

Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch has just turned 70 and to celebrate Media
Guardian has created an online tribute.

In its birthday special "Seven Ages of Murdoch", the site tells Murdoch's
life story in seven animated cartoons. Its online birthday card has Murdoch
cutting a cake in the shape of the globe.

Tributes have been sent by The Telegraph's proprietor Conrad Black and
advertising chiefs Lord Saatchi and Sir Martin Sorrell. Says former Pearson
MD Frank Barlow: "Whether you love him or hate him, you can't help but
admire his achievements which are immense indeed." Visitors can send their
own tributes to the site's editor.

Attached for your review is Legislative Digest #8.  It has been delayed 
reaching you due to technical difficulties.
 
 - Digest8.doc


I am disappointed that Joe Grundfest will not be able to join us at our next 
Advisory Council meeting.  However Tom Campbell sounds like an excellent 
alternative.  Would you please contact him and see if he might be willing to 
join us for the next meeting and talk about the subjects you suggested.  
Incidentally, we're happy to pay an honorarium to any of our guest speakers. 

I think I should pass at this time on inviting Spence Abraham to join us for 
dinner.  First, I believe it would be virtually impossible for him to do that 
at this point in time.  But second, many people are already blaming me for 
being the real energy policy maker in the new Administration and I would just 
as soon not feed that speculation.  

Look forward to seeing you.  

Warm regards,

Ken

Subject: Grundfest


Joe and I hve had several conversations trying to work out his schedule, but
his classes plus moving his parents from NYC to California at that time make
it impossible for him to come, although he would very, very much like to do
so.
I would suggest that we invite Tom Campbell, the Republican congressman who
just lost his shot at the senate against one of the two women (I forget which
one, left or lefter) and who is again teaching at Stanford Law School. He is
brilliant, and we could give him the topic of "Enron and Market-Regulatory
Failure: What Are The Constraints on Its Behavior? Where Do the Risks Lie in
the Future?" Or some such thing.
I will read When Genius Fails in the next few hours and decide about its
author.
What would you think of having Spence Abraham to dinner, and moving Bill
Kristol to the morning if Spence can come?


Hi Tom - this would be good as Ken Lay will not be able to attend next week.

Dear Nicolas:

I am pleased that you found the Cancun meeting to be a good experience.  My 
wife and I also thought if was a very enjoyable couple of days.

With reference to contacting the appropriate people representing Enron in 
Mexico, you should contact either Jaime Alatorre or Max Yzaguirre.  Either 
one of these individuals could entertain a discussion of how we might be able 
to work together.

Best regards,

Ken

keep in mind that your objective should be to provide a succinct, but 
thorough assessment of the investment that will inform a discussion on how to 
best add value and manage the investment going forward.

If you have not gotten my feedback and would like it, we can arrange to speak 
over the weekend.  I will be traveling, but if you leave a voice message, we 
can arrange a time to speak.  I will be generally available by phone Saturday 
morning through early afternoon.

Hi Jonathan -

E-mail is great.  I have copied Tori Wells on this also, as she works 
diligently on Dr. Lay's itineraries and Rob Bradley, who works on Dr. Lay's 
speeches.  We have virtually no information about the OECD Forum or the IEA 
Ministerial session except dates - May 15-16.  We have made reservations for 
Dr. & Mrs. Lay at the Bristol Hotel.  

We look forward to hearing from you.

Rosalee --  I was given your name by Bill Ramsay as the person responsible

From the IEA side, I have been tasked with the responsibility for
co-ordinating not only parts of the Ministerial session, but also the
preceding OECD Forum -- in both of which Mr. Lay is scheduled.

I am hoping to be in closer communication with you to walk through our
current planning for these meetings, and to make sure that all our i's are
dotted and t's are crossed as we move toward May.  Please let me know
whether e-mail or a telephone call would be best.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Subject: Dornbusch on Income Inequality and Pricing AIDS Medications to a  
Human Scale


Dear Dr. Lay:

New this week on www.TheGlobalist.com:

RUDI DORNBUSCH ON INCOME INEQUALITY
Poverty is bad -- but income inequality is not. MIT Professor Rudi
Dornbusch makes the argument that the development community
should not confuse inequality with poverty -- even though at the
bottom they might feel the same.

Coming Monday: A New Globalist Paper
PRICING AIDS MEDICATIONS TO A HUMAN SCALE
In a scramble for good publicity, pharmaceutical companies have
started a downward bidding war in pricing AIDS medications for
African markets. To add a much-needed measure of fairness to
the process, we propose a better alternative -- adjusting the price
of treatment to per-capita GDP.

Best regards from Washington,

Stephan Richter
Publisher and Editor-in-Chief

Also this week:

JAPAN -- DON'T TRUST ANYONE OVER 55!
During the course of its decade-long economic malaise, Japan
has tried just about every trick in the book to get its economy
growing again. We may have found the answer -- but be warned,
those over the age of 55 may not like it!

CHINA'S CARIBBEAN ISLAND HIDEAWAY
Why does China have an embassy on the tiny Caribbean island
of St. Lucia -- an island 8,000 miles away from Beijing and with which
it has few economic or political ties?
http://www.theglobalist.com/nor/gdiary/2001/03-19-01.shtml

Coming Friday: A New Globalist Bookshelf Feature
ROBERT KAPLAN ON THE TURKEY-ISRAEL AXIS
Turkey is in the midst of an economic crisis -- and Israel's relations
with the Palestinians have steadily deteriorated. So what do these
countries have to gain by forming a strategic alliance?

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: NEW ANSWERS TO NEW PROBLEMS=20

******E-NEWS THIS WEEK*******

OPEC ANNOUNCE 1M BBL/D CUTS
Geneva - OPEC members agreed further production cuts this week, announcing a
further 1m bbl/d decrease in member outputs. As a result oil prices pushed
slightly higher with NYMEX crude trading at $26.80 and IPEC crude trading at
25.06. OPEC ministers have indicated that members have highlighted $25/bbl
as a price that they feel comfortable with.The decreases per country were as
follows:

Algeria - 32,000
Indonesia - 52,000
Iran - 146,000
Kuwait - 80,000
Libya - 54,000
Nigeria - 82,000
Qatar - 26,000
Saudi Arabia - 324,000
UAE - 88,000
Venezuela - 116,000
Total - 1,000,000


ENERGY AFRICA LOOK TOWARD THE MOROCCAN DEEP
Rabat - This week the MENA Petroleum Bulletin spoke with Andrew Windham,
Group General Counsel for Energy Africa. Amina Benkhadra, General Manager of
ONAREP (25%) added to the growing list of re-entrants to Morocco, signing a
petroleum agreement with Energy Africa (63.75%) and Taurus Petroleum AB
(11.25%). This agreement, taking effect March 1st 2001, concerned three
exploration permits offshore Morocco collectively known as the Tiznit
Offshore area.
Energy Africa Morocco Ltd (operator), together with Taurus Petroleum
(co-partner) will implement exploration work on the three permits of the
Tiznit Offshore area covering approximately 6000sq.km. This is Energy
Africa's second Petroleum Agreement covering acreage offshore Morocco, the
first being the Cap Draa Haute Mer area where Energy Africa holds 20% equity
bringing the total acreage held by it in the country to 18,000sq.km.
Andrew Windham, said, 'the country has all the characteristics offshore
which make potentially, for substantial discoveries. But at this stage it is
very much untried and untested, so it is a very exciting place to be at the
moment. We are in right at the start of some new plays.'
For further details please see the April issue of the MENA Petroleum
Bulletin.


REPSOL MAKE 2ND LIBYA DISCOVERY
London - Repsol YPF SA said it discovered oil at a second well during
exploration in Libya. The well in the Murzuq Basin, 800km south of Tripoli,
produced oil at a rate of 1,300bbl/d, the company said in a press release.
Repsol is testing the site on behalf of a consortium including OMV,
TotalFinaElf and Saga Petroleum. Repsol began searching for oil in the area
in May 1998, when the Libyan government granted approval for exploration and
production sharing arrangements with foreign companies. The companies
currently produce more than 160,000bbl/d from the Murzuq Basin, said the
company.


AHMED ABDELKARIM CONFIRMED AS NEW HEAD OF NOC
Tripoli - Further to reports this week from Libya Ahmed Abdel-Karim Ahmed
has been formally appointed as Chairman of NOC, following reports that he
had been removed from the position. Representing Libya at the OPEC
conference in Geneva it was confirmed that Al-Badri has been appointed as
Deputy Prime Minister for Social Security. The news will comfort foreign
investors who feared that further upheaval would hinder an already slow
ratification process, with approvals outstanding for three packages of
blocks offered by NOC in late 2000.

*****MARKET ANALYIS REPORT NEWS*****

ALGERIAN OIL AND GAS REPORT
Approximately 90% of Algeria's crude oil exports go to Western Europe, with
Italy as the main market followed by Germany and France. Algeria accounts

demands of Iberia and the Eastern Mediterranean Basin. This will depend upon
the degree to which foreign investment can be attracted.

in Algeria, and the prime and potential markets for Algerian energy
products. Specifically, the Report will provide you with a complete analysis
on
* All major oil and gas field/projects.

MENA POWER
23 & 24th April 2001, Crowne Plaza Hotel, Dubai
For further information visit
http://www.smi-online.co.uk/middleeastpower2.asp

The timing of this conference couldn't be better as the Middle East and
North African region gears up to offer further independent power projects.

SMi forthcoming conference titled Middle East North African Power, taking
place 23rd and 24th April 2001 aims to bring together all levels of
participants to explain their understanding and thinking for the future of
Middle East and North African power development.

Many countries experience blackouts and electrical faults on a daily basis,
governments in the Middle East and North Africa are now increasingly pinning
their hopes on the Independent Power Project run in conjunction with major
International investors to solve this problem.   Relaxation of Middle East
law has allowed outside investment and many see this moving the Middle East
power industry towards privatisation.

Key Speakers at this event include:
* Engineer Mahmoud Al-Ees, Head of Planning Studies, Ministry of Energy and
Mineral Resources - Jordan
* Dr Ranald Spiers, Regional Director Middle East & Africa, National Power
Plc
* Steve Wildman, Commercial Director, Alstom Gas Turbines
* Tom Thomason, Project Manager, InterGen
* Daniel J. Meier, Area Sales Manager, ABB High Voltage Technologies
* Dr Thomas Stauffer, International Oil and Finance Consultant (Formerly
with M.I.T)

MENA Power takes place on 23rd & 24th April 2001 at the Crowne Plaza Hotel,
Dubai.  The full conference programme is available at

A review of SMi's Algerian Management Report can be found on:
http://www.smi-online.co.uk/algeria.asp

The Aims & Objectives of the Conference

Algeria has always attracted a large amount of interest from the
international oil and gas community.  With a new licensing round under
discussion and petroleum code under review, this conference aims to act as a
forum for all aspects of the oil and gas industry to come together and
discuss the future development of Algeria's oil and gas sector.  Moving away
from the traditional investing in format of conference, this forum aims to
look at specific field studies and also the future markets and developments
within the Algerian oil and gas industry.  It will focus on the commercial
opportunities that exist in helping Algeria reach these markets and allow
for strategic analysis of the impact of this supplier.  It will examine
current MENA energy flows and how they might look in the future with Algeria
asserting its role as the Mediterranean's major producing nation.

discuss your participation in more detail, please contact Wendy Parker the

activities aimed at federal Clean Air Act compliance.  Pursuant to those
meetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be
held in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area on
that day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman
of the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House
Committee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has
oversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and
interaction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.

APRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's
congressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local
officials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship
channel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.
We are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.

He has asked to end the day with a "small dinner with CEOs" to have a frank
discussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called
your office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he
and the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in
addressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we
also invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.
DeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will
obviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and advise
on strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in
attendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in
advance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before or
after the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.

RSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim
Edmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan
and Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan
Smith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.
We will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies to
attend the dinner.

My current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and
to arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at a
board member's home nearby.

I trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the
Partnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with
any questions you may have.  Thank you.

CALL TO ACTION

Alliance Activists Can Make a Difference

As the country deals with a mounting energy crisis, the Department of Energ=
y
(DOE) may be planning an estimated 30-35 percent cut in the energy
efficiency and renewable energy research and development programs budget.
The Alliance calls on all responsible citizens to  encourage the
administration to do the right thing.  Becoming an Alliance Activist is the
first step.

Senator Bingaman, Democrats, Introduce Centrist Energy Bill

Senator Jeff Bingaman (NM), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee and Chair of the Alliance to Save Energy,
introduced comprehensive legislation to shape the nation's energy policy.
``If we want to tackle [our energy] problem[s] head-on, we need a
comprehensive plan that commits to increasing domestic production and to
using energy more efficiently throughout the economy.  I believe this
legislation sets out that plan," Bingaman said.

Secretary Abraham Looks for Energy in Wrong Places

Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, addressing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
noted:  =01&America faces a major energy supply crisis over the next two
decades.=018  But Abraham, like President Bush, is looking mainly to increa=
se
our supply of oil, coal, and natural gas, rather than approach both the
supply and demand sides of the issue.  Secretary Abraham mentioned energy
efficiency only once in his entire speech, even though a reduction in deman=
d
is the quickest, cleanest, cheapest (and most reliable!) energy source at
our disposal.

Democratic Task Force Weighs in on Bush Budget

Last week, House Democrats threw their hat into the ring as the Democratic
Caucus Energy Task Force held a news conference decrying Bush Administratio=
n
intentions to cut energy research significantly in their FY 2002 budget.
The Alliance is quoted in their report, which emphasizes the role of
research and development in providing long-term energy solutions.

Senate Hearing Examines Energy-Environmental Relationship

Alliance president David Nemtzow testified at a March 21 Senate Environment
Committee Subcommittee hearing on the relationship of energy policies and
environmental policies.  Nemtzow pointed out that energy efficiency is now
our nation=01,s second largest energy source.  He also offered a series of
recommendations for the Senators simultaneously to promote energy and
environmental goals.

IPCC: Energy Efficiency is Key in Mitigating Climate Change

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the third and
final volume of its Third Assessment Report on climate change, which
examines climate change mitigation strategies and places a heavy emphasis o=
n
using energy wisely. The report finds that energy efficiency for buildings,
transportation, and industry could account for more than half of the
potential greenhouse gas reductions achievable by 2020. Natural gas
technologies, more efficient power plant technologies, and combined heat an=
d
power play an important role in reducing fossil energy power plant
emissions. And "low-carbon energy systems," such as renewable energy, can
also make an important contribution. Perhaps equally important is the
finding that there is "no single path to a low emission future."

Barriers to Energy Efficiency In Public, Private Organizations

There is a gap between the opportunities for cost-effective energy-
efficiency investment identified in energy models and the levels actually
seen in practice, according to SPRU, a science and technology policy
research group in England. The origins of the gap are claimed to lie in a
series of barriers, such as lack of capital, lack of information or hidden
costs, which prevent markets for energy and energy-using technologies from
operating efficiently.  SPRU says that understanding the size and nature of
this gap is essential if policies to mitigate climate change through
improved energy efficiency are to be successful. These policies must succee=
d
in the context of liberalizing energy markets and increasing interest in th=
e
development of a broadly based energy service industry.

State of the World Report

From the thinning of the Arctic sea ice to the invasion of the
mosquito-borne West Nile virus, the Worldwatch Institute's State of the
World 2001 shows how the economic boom of the last decade has damaged
natural systems.   The report takes a fresh look at the most difficult
challenge the world faces: how to build an environmentally sustainable
economy before we do permanent damage to the natural systems that support
our global civilization.

Dallas Cleans the Air with the IECC Energy Code

The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) voted this month to
adopt the 2000 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) for the Dallas
region.  This area accounts for almost 50,000 housing starts a year, more
than are built in 42 states.  One of the main reasons for adopting the code
is the area's commitment to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as part of the
Texas state plan for controlling smog.  Since the IECC contains a new
standard for reducing window solar heat gain, which reduces air conditionin=
g
energy use substantially, it cuts NOx emissions from the power plants that
serve the air conditioning load.  The Alliance supported Public Citizen, th=
e
Texas Building Energy Institute, the Sustainable Living Alliance, NCTCOG
staff, and others in this effort, working with the Building Codes Assistanc=
e
Project and Alliance Associates.

EYE OPENERS

Energy Efficiency Facts Even Children Can Understand

A vacant house at 55 Fahrenheit uses more energy for heating than an
occupied one at 68 Fahrenheit, according to GPU Energy.  The activity in an
occupied house radiates a certain amount of heat and some of the energy
users in your home are still operating while you areaway. Designed
specifically for teachers and students, the GPU website features
energy-related games, activities, experiments, downloadable teaching
modules, and lesson plans on a variety of energy, electrical safety, energy
conservation, and environment-related topics.

Subject:  Dinner with Tom DeLay and others on April 6th -- additional infor
      mation


To:  Bruce LaBoon, Steve Miller, Charles Duncan, Ken Lay, Steve
Letbetter, Dan Smith, Kelly Frels, Ed Galante, Jim Edmonds, Jim Kollaer

The purpose of this email is to provide additional detail to follow up on
the phone call each of you received on Friday, checking availability for
dinner with Congressman DeLay and others on Friday, April 6th.

BACKGROUND  During the last week of February, BCCA and Partnership leaders
met separately with Congressman DeLay, Congressman Joe Barton and with two
top staff members of Mr. DeLay, in order to update them on our extensive
activities aimed at federal Clean Air Act compliance.  Pursuant to those
meetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be
held in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area
on
that day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman
of the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House
Committee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has
oversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and
interaction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.

APRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's
congressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local
officials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship
channel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.
We are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.

He has asked to end the day with a "small dinner with CEOs" to have a frank
discussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called
your office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he
and the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in
addressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we
also invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.
DeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will
obviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and
advise
on strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in
attendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in
advance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before
or
after the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.

RSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim
Edmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan
and Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan
Smith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.
We will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies
to
attend the dinner.

My current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and
to arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at
a
board member's home nearby.

I trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the
Partnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with
any questions you may have.  Thank you.

Hi Mr. Reed -

I left a message on Thursday evening for Rosemarie, but was out Friday, so 
was too busy to follow up today, but having said all that, Ken Lay wanted me 
to let you know that he would like to have the TFA board meeting at the Enron 
building.  Please let me know if that will be possible.

Subject: GOOD NEWS!...and TFA Board meeting


Gentlemen,

Technology For All (TFA)received today our 501(c)(3) exemption letter
from the IRS.  This letter gives us the opportunity to vigorously
pursue new funding opportunities and also validates what we have known
all along. TFA is a charitable organization serving the underserved in
communities across the US.

We thank Jack Clark, our general counsel, for his arduous pro-bono
legal work over the past 15 months that helped make this happen.
THANKS JACK!!!

On another note, each of you should have received word from Rosemarie
Foster, TFA's Administrative Assistant, regarding a Technology For All
Board meeting scheduled for Tuesday, May 8, 2001 at the University
Hilton on the University of Houston Campus.  The meeting will take
place at 2:00 PM and conclude by 3:30 PM.  It will take place in the
context of an all-day Technology For All sponsored conference "Digital
Divide: A Call to Action".  Each of you will receive an complimentary
invitation to the activities of the day.  Ken Lay will be hosting a
CEO breakfast at 8:00 am.  Our purpose there will be to tell the TFA
story and invite the CEO's present to make a commitment to help TFA
eliminate the digital divide across Houston and beyond.  At lunch,
Greg Priest, CEO of SmartForce, will be speaking. SmartForce recently
gave TFA access to all its online eLearning content.  This gift will
allow TFA to provide workforce training opportunities to half a
million persons over the next three years.  We will thank SmartForce
during the luncheon for their enormous gift which has a retail value
that could be as high as nine figures (depending on the number of
courses utilized).

Regards,

Will

Dear Ken,

We regret that your schedule did not permit you to visit with us this week
to discuss the Center's Global Change Program.  We do understand that the
White House probably has priority.

Rosalee indicated that you are available to meet at the Center on May 24th.
the day before the Board of Trustees meeting.  May I suggest that we invite
some members of the Steering Committee to join us on the 24th to review
where we are, the political environment, and continued Center involvement
in this program area.  As you are aware we have had discussions with the
Turner Foundation on a Leadership Forum and have developed several projects
which have each received partial funding commitments from the federal
government or private foundations.    Paul O'Neill, Tim Wirth, Bill Miller,
Teresa Heinz and Michael Oppenheimer are my suggestion of Steering
Committee members to join us.  Please give me your thoughts.

As always, Mary Hope

Mr. Lay,
?
Your assistant contacted me a couple weeks back with the message that the  
attached was not an opportunity you could consider at this time.? Thanks  
very much, though, for taking a look at it.
?
I have one follow-up question for you -- could you recommend another Enron  
executive that might be a candidate for such an opportunity?? 
?
To help you answer the question, the company is Juno Online?Services,  
Inc.?(NASDAQ: JWEB), a leading US ISP.? Juno is very interested in  working 
with (and in advanced-stage discussions with) companies in the energy  
industry and working with them on strategic telecommunications and marketing  
partnerships.
?
Information about Juno is available at "About Juno" on Juno's Web site 
http://www.juno.com.? I've also attached an  executive summary to update you 
(or the relevant person at Enron) as to the  current status of Juno's 
business.
?
Thanks very much for your assistance, and I hope that this message finds  you 
well.
?
Best,
?
Toby
?
Executive Overview of?Juno --

The company finished 4Q00 w/ $56MM in cash.? Total net loss for 2001  was 
projected to be $10-$25MM, as the company focuses on billable services,  
continues to reduce expenses, and looks to develop advertising and other  
ancillary revenue streams.? The company is confident that it can meet  
or?beat the loss target and made explicit statements that on-hand cash  
resources are "more than adequate" to get the business profitable.? The  
company has not publicly given a time-line for profitability to maintain  
flexibility.  
The company controls one of the largest dialup subscriber audiences (4MM  
active subscribers as of 4Q00, 850K of whom are billable) on the Internet  
today and is the 4th largest US ISP (after AOL, ELNK, and MSN).  
2000 revenue came in at $114MM, 65% of which was derived from subscription  
fees and 35% from advertising.? 2001 revenues are expected to come in  
between $100MM-$120MM, with the revenue mix moving toward 80% subscription 
and  20% advertising due to increased focus on billable services and the 
soft  Internet advertising markets.  
Juno has announced broadband agreements for its Juno Express product  
covering all mainstream broadband transport platforms -- AT&T Broadband,  
Time Warner Cable, and Comcast (cable); Covad (DSL); Hughes (satellite); and  
Metricom (wireless).  
The company has announced wireless distribution agreements for it's Juno  
Mobile product with Palm and Sprint PCS.? Other agreements are likely to  be 
forthcoming.  
The company has powerful propietary technology assets that give it a  
competitive advantage.? The company has launched (internally but not  
publicly) a new business unit -- Juno Solutions -- to investigate the  
opportunity to license these technology assets to third parties both  
domestically and internationally.?  
The Juno Virtual Supercomputer Project represents another example of  Juno's 
efforts to develop ancillary revenue streams.? This distributed  computing 
initiative aims to leverage unused computer processing power from  Juno's MMs 
of subscribers, aggregating it for sale to biotech, pharmaceutical,  and 
computational chemistry firms.?

Dear Kenneth, 
I was wondering if you could tell me if Enron is currently considering an IT 
department portfolio management solution, which is basically software that 
manages IT projects and the availability, as well as the skill sets, of your 
internal IT staff. If you would be interested, I can forward you information 
on our product, or arrange an onsite demonstration. Thank you.

Subject: Final Draft -- SEC Report on Valuation


  Attached please find the final draft.  Tim Koller and I hope
it reflects all the changes suggested on the last conference call.  Of
course, we will never be able to satisfy everyone to the last detail, but I
think we came as close as we will get.

  There is still some proof reading and minor editing to do,
and we are working on that even as we send this off.

  To the best of my knowledge there may now be two "individual
views"  to go into what is now Attachment D.  Len Baker may feel that the
language on Safe Harbor doesn't go far enough.  Baruch Lev feels that the
SEC should not only issue a "concept release" to solicit broad public
comments on a "supplementary framework for reporting intangibles," but it
should create a task force to do the work.  (Most of the group feels this
approach is too close to asking the SEC to mandate change.)  Baruch also
feels that in relying so much on voluntary disclosure, we are exaggerating
what companies will, in fact, disclose. My suggestion, Len and Baruch, is to
write a paragraph or two for Attachment D, if you wish.  Hopefully, both of
you will begin with a sentence supporting the report in general, but if you
feel strongly that the report doesn't reflect all your views, please do
state them for the record.

  Before we schedule a final call for last minute details,
etc,  I'd like to request an e-mail, fax or phone call from each of you
letting me know if you can sign-off on the report.  I'd appreciate this by
Monday, April 16th.

  Thanks a million.

  Best regards,
  Jeff

Thanks.

Subject: RE: for Rosalee - re Mr. Lay's participation at IEA ministerial


Dear Rosalee,

 I would again like to thank Mr Lay for agreeing to take part in both
our IEA ministerial session and in the OECD Forum 2001 - Sustainable
Development and the New Economy.  As discussed, he is to chair the first of
two energy panels at the FORUM; his is titled "Fuelling Sustainable
Development".  On his panel will be Mr Kurt Yeager of EPRI (speaking on
hydrocarbon issues), Mr Luis Echavarri, the head of the OECD's Nuclear
Energy Agency (speaking on nuclear power), and Danish Minister of Energy and
Environment, Svend Auken (speaking on renewables and energy efficiency).
The panel is scheduled to take place starting at 3pm at the Cit, des
Sciences et de l'Industrie, in La Villete, in northern Paris.

As I believe I noted in our previous e-mail communications, while the IEA is
responsible for organising our ministerial session and the substantive
issues related to the energy panels on the FORUM, the OECD is doing the
FORUM logistics.  They have therefore asked that I forward to all speakers
the following note (see below). It asks that Mr Lay provide a number of
logistical inputs, including a biography and photo, as well as information
on any remarks he might choose to make. I note that as the chair of the
first energy panel, he may not wish to make a formal presentation -- but
time does permit this if he wishes, and the decision is at his discretion.
I would appreciate being a cc on any material you send to the OECD so we can
keep our files current.

On our own side, the IEA concluded its Governing Board Meeting last Friday,
and finally approved the ministerial session agenda and arrangements.  While
Mr Priddle will be sending out a formal invitation and set of background
documents to Mr Lay this week, I wanted to give you a heads up and find out
if you had any "last-minute" questions which I might help answer.

In addition, I note that your last e-mail indicated Mrs Lay will be in Paris
during our session.  Some of our ministerial representatives are also
planning to bring spouses (in particular US Energy Secretary Abraham, who is
coming with his wife) -- do you think Mrs Lay might wish to participate in
any events during this period with any of these others?  If you let us know,
we would be happy to make arrangements.

Also, please let us know if others will be travelling with Mr Lay, and if we
might facilitate their logistics.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,

Jonathan Pershing

Subject: CONFIDENTIAL:  HR Committee Approval Requested for Option Grant


In light of Jesse Greene's acceptance of the SVP, Strategy position, we have
re-examined his option opportunity for 2001.  As you recall, we deferred a
decision on his option grant in December 2000 pending a decision on his
status.

Now that Jesse has accepted this new role, we are recommending a grant of
125,000 stock options, which is comparable to the December 2000 grant to
other 16b officers in staff positions.  As a point of reference, below are
the option grants made to 16b officers in December 2000:

Blackmore - 375k
Winkler - 350k
Larson - 275k
McDowell - 250k
Elias - 150k
Jackson - 175k
Siekman - 155k
Napier - 155k
Fox - 125k
Milton - 100k
Clarke - 75k (received additional grant of 175k options upon appointment to
CFO)
Walker - 60k (received 250k new hire options in September)
Robison - 0 (recently received new hire grant)

If you have any questions or concerns about this proposal, please let Yvonne
or I know.  If it is acceptable, please advise and we will provide a
unanimous consent for your signature to formalize.  Thank you!

Beau, Ken would like to do this if we can arrange it.  He has a video to 
receive the United Way Kneebone Award from Gerald Smith at 2:30 on Monday, 
May 7.  I'm thinking that maybe we could do this video at 2:00 p.m.  That is 
a lot to do two videos back to back, I guess, but there is very limited time 
available and I think the United Way one will be pretty easy.  Will 30 
minutes be sufficient?

Ken -
?
Child Advocates'? 9th annual "Pull for Kids  Sporting Classic" is honoring?
Harry  Reasoner.? Lannie Earthman, at Child Avdocates, told me that they  are 
putting together a short video (a tribute to Harry) for?the night of  the 
event.? Harry doesn't know about the video so it will be a  surprise to him 
that evening.? I've been told by Lannie that, at  Macey's request, those 
being videoed are Dr. Ralph Faigan (Baylor College of  Medicine), Steve 
Miller (CEO, Shell), Malcolm Gillis (President, Rice Univ.),  and hopefully 
you.? Baylor College of Medicine is filming and producing  it.? If you would 
agree to do it, they can film you at your office at your  convenience.? It 
probably wouldn't take very long, unless of  course?you had a whole lot to 
say about Harry.? They want to have it  finished in the next couple of weeks, 
because the event is only a month away  (May 19th).
?
FYI, the Family Foundation?has always  supported the event and this year 
contributed $25,000 (the highest sponsor  level).? I don't think that you and 
Mom are planning on attending the event  or anyone else in the family.
?
Let me know if you would be interested in this so  that I can help facilitate 
it.

I appreciate the e-mail concerning the Board of Trustees for The Institute

I am still thinking about the possibility of serving on your board.  But at 
the earliest, it would be late this year before I could entertain any 
involvement.  With your indulgence, I will keep you advised.

Warm regards,

Sorry I hadn't responded sooner.  I was trying to get Mr. Lay out of town.  
Actually July 12 may work for him.  He is out of the office until June 12,

Dear Ken,

We regret that your schedule did not permit you to visit with us this week
to discuss the Center's Global Change Program.  We do understand that the
White House probably has priority.

Rosalee indicated that you are available to meet at the Center on May 24th.
the day before the Board of Trustees meeting.  May I suggest that we invite
some members of the Steering Committee to join us on the 24th to review
where we are, the political environment, and continued Center involvement
in this program area.  As you are aware we have had discussions with the
Turner Foundation on a Leadership Forum and have developed several projects
which have each received partial funding commitments from the federal
government or private foundations.    Paul O'Neill, Tim Wirth, Bill Miller,
Teresa Heinz and Michael Oppenheimer are my suggestion of Steering
Committee members to join us.  Please give me your thoughts.

As always, Mary Hope

Subject: Gerald Smith

Over the past few months, Enron Global Finance has been evaluating various 
opportunities where Enron and Smith Graham & Company may be able to work 
together.  Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at 
Smith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since 
reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a 
proposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan 
portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this 
money ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with 
Smith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about 
$235 million.)

The proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its 
quarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the 
Committiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation 
to minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is 
looking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be 
reached sometime in May.  We have not communicated the specific details of 
our intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.

I am available for further discussion at your convenience.

Regards,
Tim DeSpain

Dear Colette:

 In response to your e-mail concerning the upcoming New Delhi World Forum, I 
would expect that this forum should evaluate the impact of what is happening 
on our project at Dabohl with reference to enticing other foreign 
investment.  As you probably know, the State of Maharastra has been slow 
paying and no paying for the electricity from our plant at Dabohl for 
sometime and more recently both the State of Maharastra  and the Government 
of India have refused to honor their government guarantees on this project.  
We have filed a political force majeure on the project and indeed will be 
moving into arbitration on that and a number of other issues in London in the 
not too distant future.  Again, I believe this will send a very negative 
signal to the market place as to the advisability of international companies 
investing in India.  I would think you might want to build one panel around 
this subject.  

 If there's any way we can be of help, let me know.

Best regards,

Ken Lay

Subject: India Economic Summit 2001, New Delhi 2-4 December


To the attention of:
Dr Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman
Enron


Dear Dr Lay,

When the Minister of Finance of India Yashwant Sinha recently presented the
2001-2002 national budget, it was widely acknowledged as a very ambitious
"dream budget" which puts India on a high growth trajectory. Most key
sectors should benefit from these reforms, which will thus give a new boost
to the country's economic and social progress. As such, the budget was
welcomed with great enthusiasm by the Indian and international business
community.

On the occasion of our India Economic Summit 2001 to be held in partnership
with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) from 2 to 4 December in New
Delhi, it will be the perfect time to assess the progress of the bold and
extensive measures proposed in the recent budget, how they have been
implemented and how they have impacted the business environment, domestic
industry activity and foreign investment.

As we will soon be preparing the preliminary programme of the Summit, I
would like to take the opportunity to benefit from your expertise and
understanding of the country. I would greatly appreciate receiving from you
any particular topics or issues that you wish to see given priority on the
agenda. Any suggestions of relevant speakers or experts that you may have
would also be welcomed.

I look forward to receiving your response at the above e-mail address and
kindly ask you to copy my colleague Mitra Khoubrou (e-mail:
mitra.khoubrou@weforum.org).

For more information on the 2001-2002 Union Budget, please visit the
website of the Ministry of Finance of India at http://finmin.nic.in/fub.htm

I look forward to hearing from you and hope that you will be with us in
India again next December.

Best regards,

Colette Mathur,
Director,
Center for Regional Strategies
World Economic Forum

Subject: EGM - all company meeting

Ken,

Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the 
Hyatt Regency.  The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for 
an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within 
EGM.  This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we 
expect about 500 people.  

We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of 
these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have 
come in a few months.  

I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.  We had 
a record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin.  That was 50% of what they 
made in all of 2000.  Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone 
we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact.

If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way 
in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now 
core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.

Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information 
or assistance.

Mike

I appreciate the brief e-mail concerning The Continental article.  It turned 
out to be a nice article.

I have been in and out of London in recent weeks but not there for any 
extended stay.  I believe my next extended stay in London will be this Fall.  
I will attempt to come by and check your products out.

My very best to you.

Dear Steve:

 The Galleo mobile multimedia communicator looks very interesting.  As you 
may know, I am on the Compaq Computer board.  They have a very successful 
product that is somewhat similar referred to as the iPAQ.  They also have 
other wireless machines which I use.  I think for the time being I do not 
necessarily need to add one more.  But I do appreciate you thinking of me.

Subject: for Rosalee - re Mr. Lay's participation at IEA ministerial


Rosalee -- I just wanted to follow up to see if there are any further
questions you (or Mr Lay) have had with regard to the OECD FORUM and IEA
Ministerial sessions scheduled for 15-16 May here in Paris.  The schedule is
as I sent it to you in April -- although there may be some changes with the
events at the Ministerial dinner.  Here, while we are still intending that
Mr. Lay provide a summary of the FORUM session to the ministerial
participants, we may need to re-order the dinner agenda slightly to
accommodate Secretary Abraham's schedule.  We will keep you posted.

I would also appreciate receiving a copy of the CV that you sent to the OECD
for our own files; we are trying to compile a full set of all participants
for use during the sessions.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,

Jonathan Pershing



Hi Mr. Pfeffer -

Dr. Lay asked me to tell you it's fine to proceed ahead with the 2001 date.  
It looks available on his schedule.  Please let me know if you need

Dear Dr. Lay,
        In my last note, I believe I promised to check on the dates for the
Faculty-Alumni Awards ceremonies in the future.  The University and the MU
Alumni Association have them scheduled for:
        October 26, 2001,
        October 4, 2002, and
        October 10, 2003.
As I mentioned, the nominations are due February 1st of each year, and
attendance at the awards ceremony is necessary in order to receive it.  The
process is competitive, but I would like to proceed with your nomination
this coming winter if the 2001 date is available on your schedule.
        I visited with Mr. Purdy yesterday about a project at the Evans
Scholars House.  He and Mrs. Purdy seem to be doing fine - and enjoying the
spring sunshine!
        I look forward to visiting with you again.  Until then, I am
Cordially yours,
Wally Pfeffer
Past-President, Leaders
College of Arts & Science

p.s.  hope you have a relaxing holiday weekend!


Ken, Ken Lay said he is fine with this.

Subject: Re: Lawsuit


Gentlemen;

You may or may not be aware, but each of you has been named as a defendant
in a lawsuit.  The lawsuit has been filed by a Plaintiff who is represented
by one of the law firms which has filed suit against i2 in the class action
lawsuit (i.e. the Nike situation).  The Plaintiff in this lawsuit is a
nominal shareholder and acts as a front for the Plaintiff law firm.

What makes the lawsuit different from the class action is that it is a
shareholder derivative lawsuit.  What this means is that the plaintiff
shareholder has filed the lawsuit against each of you to collect damages on
behalf of i2.  The claim is based on the Nike facts, but the Plaintiff is
claiming i2 has been damaged by your actions.   What is interesting is that
all damages recovered would go to i2.  So why the lawsuit?  The Plaintiff
can recover for all legal fees he incurs in bringing the lawsuit.
Derivative actions commonly follow class action filings, as a sort of
"tag-along" type of action.

The Plaintiff attorney has requested that i2 accept service of the lawsuit
on your behalf.  Normally, I would say no and let the Plaintiff law firm
try and track you down, but they may try and serve you at an inappropriate
time, i.e. client meeting, during a speech.  Please let me know if you
would like for us to accept service on your behalf.  This is very common
practice.

I will send each of you a copy of the lawsuit.  Needless to say, you are
indemnified for this, i2 will pay for all legal fees incurred to defend you
and i2 does have insurance to cover this matter.

Please let me know of your decision to have i2 accept service on your
behalf.

Thanks

Ken and I just cut short our Italy trip with friends to return to Houston
for the birth of our 6th grandchild (which is the final one for this round
of four pregnancies).  We were happy to return home and I am a very thankful
and thrilled grandmother (aka Momie, Mamamia, Mamia, Mia).  This was the
first live birth that I have personally witnessed since my last baby, Beau,
and it was VERY exhilarating and VERY emotional, as evidenced by the
attached photos.  I hope you will enjoy seeing my new grandson "Pate David
Herrold" (Pate was Courtney's maiden name) who was born on June 8, 2000 at
7:19 p.m.  Pate was 7 lbs, 10 ozs, 20 inches long with a lot of dark curly
hair.  I think he looks exactly like David at birth, but time will tell.
These photos were taken in the delivery room within the first 15-20 minutes
of his birth prior to being cleaned up and returned to the nursery.  He
looks pretty darn good for just having arrived into this world with such
great force.  So far, he is a VERY calm and good infant just like his Daddy
was.  Enjoy!  Big kiss and lots of love, LPL

Hi -

Just to let you know that it looks like one day will work.  I want to check 
with Mr. Lay before confirming.

Thanks.

Subject: Meeting with Arthur Levitt in September


 Dear Ken,

 As you know, our next meeting is on Wednesday, July 12 from
3:00-5:30 p.m.  In the next week or so, we'll be sending around a discussion
paper which we hope crystallizes the issues, and we will try to talk to as
many of you as possible before the meeting to go through it.

 Meanwhile, Arthur Levitt has agreed to meet with us in September to
brainstorm on the ideas we've generated and also to give us a sense of some
of the issues as he sees them.  There are three possible dates for the
meeting, which I suggest be in two parts -- first, a meeting among the panel
only from 5:00-6:30 p.m., and then a dinner with Chairman Levitt from
6:30-8:30 p.m.  Here are the dates:

 Could you please let us know which of these would be possible for
you:


  ___________ Thursday, September 14  5:00-8:30 pm

  ___________ Monday, September 25  5:00-8:30 pm

  ___________ Wednesday, September 27 5:00-8:30 pm



 Many thanks,
 Jeff Garten



Thank you for your recent request for Mr. Lay to speak at your conference.  
Unfortunately, do to Mr. Lay's schedule he will not be able to participate.

Thank you again,

Hello Janice:

 I enjoyed your recent e-mail but was sorry to hear about your dad.  It 
sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly.  These are always 
difficult times.  As I watched my mother and father's health deteriorate and 
ultimately watched them die, it is a very defining time in our lives.  But we 
can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege 
to have been raised in such loving homes.

 Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU.  He is joining an 
excellent company.  I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his 
education working toward an MBA.  As we are living in an age where 
intellectual capital is so valuable, it is important for every young person 
to obtain the very best possible education they can.  As to our family, 
within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a 
young man from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They met while they were both 
working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires.  They're currently on their 
honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to 
Miami, Florida.  This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born.  It 
was born to our son David and his wife Courtney.  It was a 7 lb., 10 oz.,  20 
inch little boy.  So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters 
ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days.  They are a great 
deal of fun.  We are doing quite well.  I am looking forward to seeing Ginger 
"Rees" Copeland when she comes to Houston.  I would be delighted to arrange 
tickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit 
Houston.

 I hope you have a great summer.
Dear Mr. Carmona -

Everything you have is correct.  I don't have an exact arrival time on July 
28 at this point.

Dear Rosalee:

As far as we know, Kenneth Lay is planning to take a private jet to
participate in Aspen ISIB's Business Leaders Dialogue taking place in Aspen,
Colorado, July 27 - 30th. He will be a little late - arriving July 28th. In
addition, it is our understanding that he will not require sleeping
accommodations at the Aspen Meadows for the period of the Dialogue.

If any aspect of this information is incorrect or if there have been any
changes in his itinerary or required accommodations, please let us know
immediately.

Kind Regards, and Many Thanks for your help and patience in this process.


Kind Regards,


Godwin Carmona
Program Coordinator
Aspen ISIB




As we discussed, the date that Ken thinks is best for the United Way Kick-off 
is August 9 at the conclusion of the Employee Meeting.  He thinks it would be 
fine to do the presentations there and then move on to whatever activity is 
planned.

Thanks for everyone's patience.

Rosie
Dear Family,
As you can see below, at 90 years young, Daddy (aka Pop-Pop) has his own
e-mail address and can be reached online.  I am sure that he would love to
hear from you from time-to-time.  I'm sure he would especially like to be
updated with recent photos of you and your families...me too!  If you have
any other family members e-mail addresses, let me know.  Big Kiss.  Love,
Linda/Mom/Aunt Linda

Hi Donna -

Ken said that the letter is fine.  Do you want to send us a list of the past 
Fathers and let us send the letters?

Let me know.

Subject: Solicitation to Past Fathers of the Year


Ken,
  Thank you so very much for thinking of this idea.  It is so timely and
certainly fits with Kirbyjon's challenge. I have spoken with Hardie (who
also edited this letter for me) and we both agree that this would have much
greater impact if it came directly from you, as a past Father of the Year.
As you can see we attributed the information about our shortfall directly
to me, so I am involved in the letter but not doing the solicitation.  If
you are not comfortable with this, just let me know and I will redo the
letter.  I think if you agree to send this out over your signature it would
be enormously helpful.  Please let me know what you'd like me to do.

  Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and continuous support.

On Tuesday, July 25, I am meeting with Molecular Electronics Corp. (MEC) to 
discuss the opportunity for establishing this newly formed company in 
Houston.  For those of you that are not familiar with MEC, they are 
considered one of the premier companies in the area of molecular computing.  
MEC has approached Enron to discuss a possible alliance that would facilitate 
their development and, in particular, location in the Houston area.  MEC 
represents the frontier of computing technology.

I would like to invite you to participate in a working lunch discussion of 
the opportunities and obstacles facing a company that is seeking to change an 
industry.  I would appreciate it if you could join us on July 25  from 11:30 
to 1:30 in EB49C1 for this informal roundtable with the CEO of MEC, Harvey 
Plotnick and one of the founders, Jim Tour.

Will you please let Vanessa Groscrand know if you can attend at 713-853-1769 
or please reply by e-mail to me.

Ken Lay
Linda, before we knew that you and Ken were going to the VIP reception, Ken 
had me ask if others could attend in your place.  I did ask and they have 
just called me that Nancy Kinder said that it is o.k. for the Vermeils and 
the Herrolds to attend, in addition to you and Ken.  They did ask if we would 
not spread it around as others have asked and they have not let them.

Oh, but Beau just called that Heather is ill and they are cancelling.  

Rosie
Kenneth Lay has approved the attached expense report for Jeff Skilling.

Dear Rosalie/Dorothy:

Tomorrow, we are sending to all participants via Airbourne, reading

We have noticed that our mailing address for Mr. Lay is a p.o. box.
Unfortunately, our express courier will not ship to a p.o. box.  Is there a

Dear Dad and Mark,
I am attaching the first draft of my resume in hopes
that you may be able to provide suggestions on making
it even better. Also, if you have any ideas on
contacts in Miami for work, that would be great. I am
going to routes in looking for a job, one money, one
love. The money route will be with a law firm or
preferrably a company looking of counsel for
government relations, energy background, etc.  The
second track will be on the more dolphin hugging side
such as marine conservation groups.
Let me know you thoughts.
I love you both,
Liz Vittor

Dear Mr. Lay,

As you are no doubt aware your colleague Jeffrey Skilling  recently made a=

keynote address at our flagship event RISK 2000 in Boston.  Building on the=
=20
success of that event, I would like to invite you to make the  keynote=20
address at Energy & Power Risk Management  Conferences=01, third annual=20
information technology event as  outlined above. This year's keynote sessio=
n=20
is entitled "The E-Commerce Revolution: Innovations and  opportunity in the=
=20
electronic energy marketplace". This session has no  bullet points as I wou=
ld=20
like the speaker to address only the latest issues as  they see fit. My=20
research has showed that the industry is very interested in  your opinions =
on=20
this subject and I hope you can fit this hour-long session into  you busy=
=20
schedule.

=01+Information Technology=01, will take a focused look  at the latest adva=
nces=20
being made in the energy market=01,s systems and  technologies. The confere=
nce=20
will be structured in two streams, offering  delegates and speakers the=20
chance to tailor the event to their own areas of  interest. The streams wil=
l=20
be partitioned into five areas:=20

1) Information technology for risk management

2) Information technology for pricing and trading

3) Data techniques and strategies

4) Advanced technologies for trading and risk management

5) Challenges of the evolving energy marketplace

Each of these categories will investigate the kind of problems  being faced=
=20
by energy IT/IS managers, traders and risk managers alike. I have  attached=
 a=20
copy of the program for your information. There will also be a  software=20
exhibition at the conference at which vendors will be demonstrating  their=
=20
products, as well as a post-conference seminar on data management.

This conference will be of the highly technical level that  people have com=
e=20
to expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage  participation=
=20
from speakers in modifying the program to suit the audience and  issues at=
=20
hand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please  let=
=20
me know; any help would be gratefully received.

This event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy  & Power Risk=20
Management Magazine and our extensive database. It is my aim to  attract th=
e=20
leading market players by providing a first-class program with  top-rated=
=20
speakers, making this a highly worthwhile event for the energy  industry.

Unfortunately my schedule for this program is very tight. I  would greatly=
=20
appreciate an email soon to let me know if you would like to take  part in=
=20
this event. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to  ge=

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Dad,
Just wanted to give you some more to think about. What
I would really like to find is a job that combines my
interest in politics, my legislative skills, with my
passion for marine conservation.  This can expand to
environmental conservation.

The number one corporate target for me is the
Discovery Channel in Miami. They do have a fairly
significant office there and I am going to try and
make contacts at Discovery.

One option I am considering is working on the Bush
campaign from now until November in hopes during that
time I will make contacts in South Florida.
Unfortunately, they are not doing a significant amount
of work in South Florida.

I'll be around this weekend and would appreciate any
input.
I love you!
Elizabeth

Dear Kenneth,

 Hello! I wanted to inform you of an exclusive Delphi Event.  Attached is a 
letter from Tom Koulopoulos, The Delphi Group's CEO, explaining the details 
for our upcoming Executive Retreat to be held on August 28-29 in Aspen. This 
is going to be a truly unique experience.

 I would like to extend you and other senior level executives at Enron an 
invitation to this  event. I have already invited George Short. This event is 
limited attendance since the St. Regis Aspen can only accommodate 200. The 
early registration fee is $2500.00 per seat.

 I will follow up with you later in the week. In the meantime, if you have 
any questions, please e-mail or call me at 617-247-1511.

Subject: 2nd Annual Enron/MDA Beach Bowl


Hello, Mr. Lay! Enron and MDA are joining together again to do a 2nd Annual 
Beach Bowl to raise money for MDA. Last year, the event was a great success, 
raising over $70,000.  This year's goal is to raise $100,000, so the 
fundraising benchmarks for all teams have been raised. The money raised will 
be used to further research for ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).

I have put together a team of Analyst interns (Howard Goldfarb, Rachel 
McPhaul, Nicole Brady, Bradley Aiken and myself) for a second year to help in 
this cause.  The benchmark for the team is the raise $600 (pre-matching), but 
I want to outdo the fundraising of $1400+ (post-matching) we did last year.

I am asking for a donation to MDA to help our team bowl in this event.  
Checks are payable to MDA.

FYI, Enron matches all donations $20 or more. 

The event will take place on Saturday, July 29, 2000.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks! Have a great day!

Hi Deborah -

Ken Lay does want to meet with you re:  your earlier e-mail.  I know this 
sounds incredible, but the really best date is not until September 26!!!  His 
schedule is just not to be believed!!!  He is pretty free that day, so he 
could do an early afternoon.  Would 2:00 p.m. work for you?

Thanks.

Dear Mr. Lay:
             My name is James Partsch-Galvan. I am the Libertarian Candidate
for Texas Rep. 147. I do not support this new Sports Arena Deal. I was on the
winning side last year, and I am galvanizing to be be on the winning side
this year.
I find it very deporable that the Sports Authority cancelled its Board
Meeting tomorrow. This is another dirty trick that the Sports Authority is
making to make it harder for citizens to voice their opinions. This is one
more reason for taxpayers to vote no for any taxpayer funds to fund a new
arena that is not needed.
Sincerely, James Partsch-Galvan

Hi Mr. Grady -

I did talk to Joe Hillings this morning, who is currently in Philadelphia, 
and he said that is great for you to attend.  In addition, I did talk to Ken 
and he said "absolutely", so please plan on it.

Ken and Linda will arrive in Philadelphia tomorrow night.

Greetings from the GOP Convention.  I notice on my master schedule that
Enron is hosting a cocktail party on Wednesday from 5 to 7.  I was wondering
two things:

1.  Is it alright if I come by, as a member of the Advisory Committee?  And,

2.  Will I see you there?

Hope all is well and that I will see you in Philadelphia.
I am staying at the Sheraton University City as a member of the California

Ken-I have revised the term sheet provided to us by George yesterday along
the lines that you suggested to give the partners somewhat stronger rights
on the choice of seats and suites.  These rights are not as strong as the
rights the Partnership got from the Astros, but I hope they will be
considered sufficient by the partners.  I received an e-mail yesterday from
Conoco reiterating Archie's concern on the preferential rights.  So far, all
of the partners  I've heard from on the financing term sheet are OK with it.
However, I haven't yet heard from Ric Campo on the financing term sheet.

Dictated letter from Ken Lay

Dear John:

I enjoyed your recent e-mail.  I also appreciate your kind comments 
concerning our broadband activity.  The deal with Blockbuster has been a 
great deal of fun and is opening up all kinds of additional opportunities.

I enjoyed looking through the agenda for your meeting in Sweden.  It looks 
quite informative and interesting.  Sweden is also an excellent place for a 
summer conference.

The young man you refer to in your letter should send his resume to Celeste 
Roberts at (713) 853-0555.  If he would also copy me on the letter to 
Celeste, I would be happy to follow up and make sure it is carefully 
considered.

I'm delighted that your life appears to be going very well at the current 
time.  I hope our paths will again cross in Aspen or elsewhere in the not too 
distant future.

Warm regards,

Ken
Letter dictated by Ken Lay

Gene:

 I appreciated the update on your health status.  It appears you are taking a 
very tough situation and, with help from some of the best doctors in the 
world, setting about to turn it around.  I'm sure it goes without saying that 
you know we are all pulling for you and betting on a positive outcome.

 Clearly your health is the number one issue now.  To the extent you want to 
work and can work, we are delighted to have you back in the office.  But that 
is a very distant secondary concern until you get everything done about your 
health that can be done.  If there is any way I or Enron can be of any 
further help, please let me know.

If you are inclined to accept this invitation, we could put together an 
interesting talk on the importance of good mental health to business with 
some national statistics and then segue into Enron's emphasis on wellness and 
having fun in the workplace.  Our strategy and experience will be very 
interesting to the group since it shows what a corporate leader is doing to 
become the employer of choice in the marketplace.

You could expect a full house (around 400) for the talk.  If it fits into 
your schedule, Jack Bowen said he would be delighted to be honorary chairman 
of the event.

Great--and I will be inspired with my draft of his remarks.

Rosie, could you call the phone number on the invitation, ask for Herb 
Bateman (he is the director), and tell him of the commitment?

I am out of town and do not have their number, and they called me wondering 
about Ken's decision last Friday.

Thanks,

Mr. Christman:

Thank you for your invitation for Dr. Lay to speak at your upcoming forum in 
France, the format looks wonderful.  Unfortunately, Dr. Lay has calendar 
conflicts and will be unable to participate.

If you should need further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Family,
Jose Luis and I would like to plan on coming to Aspen
on Friday December 29th through January 6th.  We would
like to stay in the Old house with you, if possible
and preferrably either the front bedroom or the guest
cottage. Please let us know if this is possible as I
need to make airline reservations ASAP.
Thanks,
love,
Liz

Hi Jaime -

Thanks for the information about the dinner.  Ken said that he would be 
flying from Aspen to New York (or Washington, if that's the city).  He said 
he would very much like to meet with you for 30 - 45 minutes before the 
dinner for a briefing.  

Thanks.

Subject: Dinner with V. Fox

Dear Ken,
 Federico Sada, who is travelling with President elect Vicente Fox in South 
America, called me this morning, 
and asked me to give you the confirmed list of attendees to the dinner in New 
York, Wednesday August 23, 8:00 P.M.
at the Watteau Room of the St. Regis Hotel:

 Sanford I. Weill   Citigroup, Inc.   Chairman and CEO
 Hendrick Verfaille  Monsanto Co.   President and CEO
 William B Harrison, Jr.  Chase Manhattan Corp.  Chairman and CEO
 Raymond V. Gilmartin  Merck and Company, Inc. Chairman and CEO
 Michael Armstrong  AT&T    Chairman and CEO
 Stephen M. Wolf  US Airways   Chairman and CEO
 Kenneth L. Lay   Enron Corp.   Chairman and CEO

Pending confirmation
 Douglas A. Warner III  J.P. Morgan   Chairman

According to Federico, if there is any late cancellation, no one will be 
substituted. Also, there is a small possibility that
the dinner could take place in Washington, rather than N.Y., based on Fox's 
meeting with President Clinton; they are still
working on the final agenda. 
 
 Max and myself are working on the background information that you will need, 
and will keep you posted of any 
changes; best regards,  jaime____

I was really disappointed you and Lavonne were not able to make the Rees

Our broadband business is doing great.  Just a few days ago, we announced a 
video-on-demand service we will be providing with Blockbuster.  It has 
created a lot of interest.

In general, my family is doing very well.  Linda and I now have six grandkids

Hi Kenny: Bonny sent me your E-mail address and
so I am trying it out. Sorry we could not make it
to the party. The temperature is very warm here
in Kansas today. I checked Enron stock recently
and it looks like it is doing fine. I am
particularly interested in your venture into the
fiber optics communications business and the
windpower. We sold our interest in the Cellular
business last year and I think the land line
company will be sold soon. We sold to Allied
Telephone Coimpany of Little Rock. Two other
engineers and myself put Kansas Cellular together
about 14 years ago. Then we built a fiber system
from East to West across Kansas. That was sold
with the Cellular. Take care of yourself-Loyal

Subject: Invitation to deliver 2001 IAEE conference keynote


Dear Ken:

Next April 25-27, 2001, Houston will host the 24th conference of the
International Association for Energy Economics, in combination with the
annual meeting of our U.S. Association for Energy Economics affiliate.  We
invite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon
on Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this
event.

Our theme is "2001: An Energy Odyssey." We are using the conference to
showcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to
deal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as
enterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to
clearly define these major themes and priorities than you.

I was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in
Montreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that
the regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t=
o
heart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the
opportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of
vital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include
comments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both
guiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in
markets on behalf of enterprises.

The IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business an=
d
university interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring yo=
u
up-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure
Rosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together
for you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc=
e
(at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In
addition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of
RD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues
and Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a
joint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology
Conference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas.

Finally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate
sponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project,
which you helped to found.  Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to hel=
p
identify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary
session, "Sustaining Development" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn
thinking around with our re-phrasing).

I hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.  We
look forward to having you with us next April!

Subject: World Economic Forum, Melbourne, Australia

The next World Economic Forum will be held September 11-13 in Melbourne.  I 
have received information from the Control Risks Group that several 
anti-capitalist and anarchist groups are planning major demonstrations to 
disrupt the proceedings. Like the earlier incidents in Seattle, large-scale 
clashes between demonstrators and police are expected.

If you or any of your staff members are planning to attend, you might want to 
consider your personal security when making hotel and local travel 
accomodations.  Corporate Security can provide local personal security agents 
if you desire.

Any non-essential travel to Melbourne during this time frame should be 
rescheduled.

Hi Mr. Moore -

I'm sorry that we didn't discuss dates this morning as Mr. Lay is on vacation 
until September 5.  As that will be his first week back after being out for 
several weeks, it is already pretty booked up. 

I will certainly share this e-mail with him.  Is it possible to update Mr. 
Lay on the progress of the Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy by 
e-mail?  Another thought might be to see if our Executive Vice President of 
Human Resources, Cindy Olson,  would be available to meet with you on August 
28 or 29.  Ms. Olson is in charge of Enron's Community Relations Department.

Please advise.

I would like to schedule a short meeting in your office to  share the 
remarkable progress that the Committee to Encourage Corporate  Philanthropy 
is making and to ask that you consider hosting a meeting for  ten to fifteen 
CEOs of other major Houston corporations to encourage their  participation in 
the only forum of CEOs focused on the agenda of corporate  giving.
?
I'm anxious to meet you as we have so many friends in  common: three of your 
directors, John Duncan, Pug Winokur and Norm Blake, and  the Slocums, to name 
just a few.
?
I look forward to hearing from you.
?
?
P.S. If it works in your schedule, I'm available to come  to Houston on 
August 28 or 29 or anytime the week of September  4.


Diane, I will definitely show this to Ken, but he has a Dain Rauscher 
presentation near the Galleria at 8:00 a.m. that morning, so I know he can't 
attend.

Subject: Alzheimer's Research Update

On September 19th Dr. Bill Thies, vice president of medical and scientific 
affairs for the national Alzheimer's Association, will be in Houston to  
provide an update on some of the new and successful research underway for 
Alzheimer's disease.  He'll also be meeting with local reseachers to learn 
what they're doing in order to support and potentially fund their work.  
Since all of you have been such great supporters of our efforts to raise 
funds for this very cause, Phil and I are hosting a breakfast so you can hear 
firsthand how your money is being spent.  No pledge cards will be handed out 
at the door--just juice, coffee and maybe a bagel.  Please join us to hear an 
update from Dr. Thies on September  19 from 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. in the Enron 
Building, Room 49C1.  Please RSVP to Adriana Wynn at X55176.

Hi!

Just a quick note to say good-bye and thank you after five and a half years!  
My last day at Enron will be Thursday, August 31st.  I will be heading off to 
two new jobs -- to be a full-time mom once Baby Lee arrives and to start my 
own stationary/invitations company.  

I have thoroughly enjoyed working with all of you.  Thank you for all the 
opportunities you have given me over the years.   For your Community

Subject: Governors Conference




Dear Ken, 

It was good to talk with you last week, and I hope you got some vacation in 
Aspen.? I'm working at it! 

Rosalie said you'd be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you 
by phone or e-mail before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you.? 
Governor Knowles (classmate of George W.), along with Governor Taft of Ohio, 
has enlisted us in a conference that seven governors are sponsoring on 
natural gas in order to elucidate the market and issues -- and needs -- 
before it explodes as a political issue -- and perhaps helps head it off (in 
contrast to what happened with gasoline).? Governor Knowles is the current 
chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be under the 
auspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and a lot of 
other distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very timely event.

They would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be kicking 
off the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high visibility 
platform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and honored -- to have 
you in that featured role in it works for your schedule.

It takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. 

Tony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms very 
large for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill you in 
further on what they would like to accomplish.

If it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, 
that would be great. 

On behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. 

Best, 

Dan 



I seem to have three appointments next week:

With regard to working out a convenient date to meet with  you, Rosalee has 
suggested that your week of September 4 is pretty well  booked-up. Would 
either September 11 or 13 work? After that I have to join Norm  Blake at the 
Olympics in Sydney. While all of this can de done by phone, as  deputy to the 
chairmen, I'm making every effort to meet (albeit briefly) with  each 
Committee member. If you are willing to host a meeting in Houston, I want  to 
make every effort to have Paul Newman in  attendance.

Subject: Arena


I wanted to make sure you were aware of something that has come up since
the last breakfast meeting regarding our group financing the Arena parking
garage.  Baker & Botts put us in touch with the Rockets to discuss Hines
being the Development Manager on the Arena and garage.  Although not fully
agreed, there is strong interest on both sides.  Besides help on the
development front, we think there may be value in our acting as a bit of a
buffer between the Sports Authority and the Rockets and coordinating any
issues involving the new convention hotel(where we are also providing
development management).  The Rockets(Mike Goldberg-Baker & Botts) have
talked to Ric Campo and supposedly he is enthusiastic but thinks this
should "be the Authority's idea.".  One issue is how much of our fee would
apply to the garage, which presumably the city would pick up, and how much
would apply to the Arena.  Since this is a fast moving issue, I wanted you
to know about this. Obviously the discussions are all very confidential.
If you have any thoughts in advance of the next breakfast meeting, please
give me a call at 713-966-2606.

Also, on another topic, we have been doing a tiny bit of pie in the sky
brainstorming on the concept of creating some kind of Futures/Options
market in the commercial space market.  I will approach Jeff Skilling
unless you would recommend elsewhere within Enron.



Ken Lay asked me to advise you that he can't do this one, but would consider 
other dates.

                Lilly and Generex Sign Agreement To Develop

                          Buccal Form of Insulin



Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Generex Biotechnology Corporation

(NASDAQ: GNBT) today announced that they have signed an agreement to

develop a buccal formulation of insulin that is administered as a fine

spray into the oral cavity using Generex proprietary technology.



Under the terms of the agreement, Generex will receive certain initial fees

and milestone payments.  Generex will also receive royalty payments based

on product sales.  In exchange, Lilly will receive exclusive worldwide

rights to products resulting from the collaboration.  Lilly will be

responsible for conducting clinical trials, securing regulatory approvals

and marketing on a worldwide basis.  Clinical trials of the first product

candidate are under way in North America and Europe.  Lilly will also have

the option to develop a number of additional products depending on the

success of the initial product.



"We look forward to working with Generex, whose buccal spray delivery

technology potentially represents a novel approach to drug delivery," said

James A. Harper, president, diabetes and growth disorders products for

Lilly. "A buccal spray formulation of insulin could provide an attractive

alternative for people with diabetes."



"The opportunity to partner with Lilly, the global leader in insulins, to

develop the world's first marketed buccal insulin spray represents very

good news for millions of patients with diabetes throughout the world,"

said Anna Gluskin, chief executive officer of Generex. "We are pleased that

Lilly has recognized the potential of buccal delivery of insulin and

Generex's RapidMist? technology for systemic delivery of proteins, peptides

and other large molecule drugs."



Today, worldwide costs for treating diabetes and its complications are

estimated to exceed $200 billion annually.  It is also estimated that, over

the next decade, the number of people with this disease will more than

double.  Lilly has been a leader in diabetes care for more than 75 years.

The company continues to aggressively pursue the goal of being a complete

diabetes care company and intends to provide innovative products to treat

all types and stages of diabetes.



Generex is engaged in the research and development of drug delivery systems

and technologies. To date, it has focused on developing a platform

technology for the buccal delivery (absorption through the inner cheek

walls) of large molecule drugs which, historically, have been administered

only by injection. Additional information about Generex can be found at

www.generex.com.



Lilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing

portfolio of best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest

research from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with

eminent scientific organizations. Headquartered in Indianapolis, Ind.,

Lilly provides answers ? through medicines and information ? for some of

the world's most urgent medical needs.



Certain statements set forth above may constitute forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. Although Generex and Lilly believe that such statements are
based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of their knowledge of
their business and operations, there can be no assurance that: (i) Lilly or
Generex will not terminate the collaboration, (ii) that any products will
be developed, manufactured or commercialized successfully, or (iii) that
significant funding will be received by Generex as a result of this
collaboration.

Each company's business is subject to significant risks and there can be no
assurance that actual results of the companies' development activities and
results of their operations will not differ materially from expectations.
For information with respect to other factors, which could cause actual
results to differ from expectations, reference is made to the 10-K and 10-Q
reports filed by Generex and Lilly, respectively, with the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Dear Dean Walker -

Ken Lay asked me to respond to you re:  1). naming the new professorship the 
Pinkney C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship - this is fine.
2)  He will be pleased to serve as the keynote speaker for the banquet on 
October 13.

Thanks.

Rosalee

Subject: P. Walker professorship and keynote request


Thanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the
professorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted that you plan to
attend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.

The purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient
way of reaching you, is two-fold:

     1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney
C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the
professorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some
other area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in
the College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.
Both Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into
Harold Hook to seek his input.

A few points of elaboration:
     * "Distinguished" is a standard adjective in the titles of such
positions.
     * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the
college to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my
approval.
     * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October
13.

This name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength,
(2) allows me to avoid any "turf battles" (either within the college or with
Economics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the
college.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.

     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society
banquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief
talk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of
business.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive
event.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now
live in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have
chosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.
Your talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed
(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.
I understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the
morning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable
for the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in
choosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you
will serve as the keynote speaker.

If you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the
plans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney
Walker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if
you have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is
573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.

Let me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not
Pinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been
experiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that
he intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.
Time permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll
see him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his
wife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I
will host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.  Of
course, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it's
my understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)

Ken, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of "R&R"
during your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.


Ms. Peppers, I am very sorry, but I must once again reschedule the 
appointment that you have with Mr. Lay.  He will be out of town the entire 
week of September 26.  

The first available time to reschedule is October 19, 2000.  Would an 
afternoon appointment work for you - about 2:00 p.m.?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Rosalee
Mr. Lay responded that he is unable to attend.  I know that you already have 
that message as someone has called, but I wanted to let you know also.

Hello Mr. Lay,

It's been a long time since we've talked.  I'm Priscilla Slade, President of
Texas Southern University.  The primary purpose of this e-mail is to invite
you to attend a weekend at the home of President and Mrs. Bush September
16-18.  So many people have expressed a desire to become know more about the
University (it's new initiatives and successes) that  President Bush
volunteered to host a gathering of 25 CEOs and spouses (or a second person
in the corporate hierarchy).  In addition to having fun golfing, sailing,
boating, etc., we are presenting ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT TEXAS SOUTHERN
UNIVERSITY.

I know this is your favorite topic and that we can look forward to you
joining us.  An invitation is in the mail.  I look forward to you joining
us.

Sincerely,

Priscilla

Mexico Meeting 2000
Managing New Expectations and Old Challenges
Mexico City, Mexico 4-5 December

Dear Dr Lay,

Mexico awoke to a new political landscape on 2 July 2000. The economic and 
business climate is positive and full of new opportunities as Mexico finally 
completes a long transition from one-party dominance to pluralist democracy, 
adding political maturity to a more competitive market economy.

In light of the above, the World Economic Forum will hold a Mexico Meeting 
2000 on 4-5 December in Mexico City. Held in collaboration with the Mexican 
Investment Board, this gathering will take place three days after the 
inauguration of the new Mexican administration. We have already received 
confirmation that President-elect Vicente Fox and Mexican Central Bank 
Governor Guillermo Ortiz will participate. We are also expecting the presence 
of the future key cabinet members and state governors.

As usual, the World Economic Forum pulls together the right group of leaders 
to discuss issues, build a network of contacts and identify where future 
business opportunities and risks lie. The Meeting will focus on four main 
topics: the country's political and social agenda, Mexico's commercial 
relationships with the rest of the world, the new economy and the key issues 
for the country's main industries.

Please consult our website, http://www.weforum.org/mexico, where information 
will be updated as soon as it becomes available.

For further information, please do not hesitate to contact Gisela Galicia at 
(41 22) 869 1450 or mailto:mexicomeeting@weforum.org

Good morning Ken,
Just wanted to take a moment to thank you for being the "Honorary Chair" for 
the Cougars@Enron golf tournament to be held on March 21, 2001.  I enjoyed 
meeting you at the "Enron Excellence Awards" presentation and genuinely 
appreciate your support.  When we spoke, you said that you may not be able to 
play in the tournament.  I certainly understand, but if you are available to 
play (or make an appearance at the dinner afterward), it would most 
beneficial to our outcome.  Please let me know if you are available.

Thanks,

Subject: New PUHCA Exemption Legislative Language

Yesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the 
attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for 
companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by 
independent market analysts (i.e. "A" rating for Holding Companies or 
investment grade rating for utility companies).  This is not a permanent 
exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.

MidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's 
reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, 
Ken Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.

The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an 
amendment to a "must pass" piece of legislation during the waning days of 
this Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' 
strategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes 
tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as 
contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to 
paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth 
Edison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. 
2944).

Senator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA 
amendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed 
to the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've 
reviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the 
concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was 
Senator Kerrey's idea.  

It is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) 
would still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact 
that Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the 
Democrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not 
he is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive 
electricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is "at least 
three years away from happening."

Steve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position 
on this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to 
oppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like 
Southern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the 
MidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access 
provisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support. 





OOps, I can't seem to open it!!

Dr. Lay:

We need a bio of you to include in the program for the Herbert J. Davenport
program on October 13. I have attached the bio of you that we used in the
brochure announcing the Pinkney C. Walker Endowment. Perhaps, with a few
adjustments, it will be suitable for this current need.

Please review the bio and send me any changes you would like made as soon as

             Eli Lilly and Company Launches Lillydiabetes.com
          New Web Site Designed To Help Patients Manage Diabetes

 Lillydiabetes.com is valuable resource for the 16 million Americans with
                                 diabetes


Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) has launched lillydiabetes.com (

http://www.lillydiabetes.com), an interactive Web site designed to help the

16 million Americans with diabetes and their families understand and manage

the disease and its complications.  The Web site provides patients

information about diabetes and gives them tools to help manage their

disease.



"Diabetes is a progressive, potentially debilitating disease that requires

regular monitoring of blood sugar, blood pressure and weight, among other

things," said Doug Rude, e-commerce team leader, Eli Lilly and Company.

"Lillydiabetes.com can help empower patients and their families with the

information and tools necessary to manage their disease and live healthier

lives."



Lillydiabetes.com has a number of features and tools to encourage

aggressive management of diabetes.  Because diabetes is a chronic,

progressive disease, it is important that patients closely track their

progress toward better blood-sugar control, as well as the development of

diabetes-related complications. Those who register with the site have

access

to customizable "Measures of Control" tools designed to help patients

monitor their diabetes and the complications that can arise.  The Measures

of Control tools include:



?    HbA1c Chart (blood-sugar control) ? Hemoglobin A1c test measures
average blood-sugar levels over a two to three-month period.  Each time an
HbA1c test is done, patients can enter the value and save it as a color
graph, which then can be used to track the patient's progress toward better
blood-sugar control.
?    Height and Weight Index ? Excess body fat can lead to insulin
resistance, a major factor in the development of type 2 diabetes.  This
tool helps patients calculate their body mass index, which is a measure of
body weight relative to height.  The Web site then provides a place to save
that information and chart progress toward desired weight.


?    Blood Pressure Chart ? A common complication of diabetes is high blood
pressure, which can lead to heart disease as well as signal other
potentially serious problems, such as diabetic kidney disease.  This tool
allows patients to enter their blood pressure levels, save them and chart
their progress.


Other resources found on lillydiabetes.com include:



Product Information ? With more than 75 years of innovation in diabetes

care, Eli Lilly and Company has developed many products for the treatment

of diabetes.  This section informs users about treatment options and the

latest breakthroughs.



Lilly Diabetes Today?  Newsletter ? Users can request to receive by e-mail

this newsletter, which provides information about the latest diabetes

developments and research, as well as recipe ideas and inspiring articles.



Patient Check List ? This section provides patients and family members with

a list of issues that should be addressed by their doctor, enabling them to

work with their physician to aggressively manage their disease.



Educational Resources ? Lillydiabetes.com provides information on an array

of diabetes-related topics.  Subject headings include:  About Diabetes,

Diabetes Management, Planning Meals, Diabetes Resources, and Diabetes

Products.



Lilly plans to add new tools and features to the site every 90 days.  The

new features will help equip patients, physicians and other health care

professionals with online tools that improve understanding of the disease

and delivery of care to patients.





Eli Lilly and Company

Lilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing

portfolio of best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest

research from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with

eminent scientific organizations. Headquartered in Indianapolis, Ind.,

Lilly provides answers ? through medicines and information ? for some of

the world's most urgent medical needs.

 Study Shows Efficacy of Zyprexa Superior to Valproate in the Treatment of
               Acute Mania Associated with Bipolar Disorder
          Study is the largest comparison of two mood stabilizers


Zyprexac (olanzapine, Lilly) provides better control of manic symptoms

during treatment of acute manic or mixed manic episodes compared with

valproate (Depakotec, Abbott), according to new data presented today at the

13th European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Congress (ECNP) in Munich.

The study is the first head-to-head comparison of Zyprexa and valproate

since the FDA's approval of the use of Zyprexa for bipolar mania in March.



Key Findings

Dosing was based on both drugs' package inserts (see Study Design for more

information). The study's primary efficacy measure was the Young-Mania

Rating Scale (Y-MRS), an 11-item scale used to assess the severity of a

patient's mania. Key study endpoint findings included:



?    The Zyprexa group experienced a significantly greater improvement on
the Y-MRS total score than did patients treated with valproate (49% vs.
38%).
?    A greater proportion of Zyprexa patients achieved remission from manic
symptoms (defined as Y-MRS Total Score < 12) compared with valproate
patients (47% vs. 34%).
?    54% of patients on Zyprexa experienced a 50% or more improvement in
Y?MRS scores compared with 42% of the valproate patients.
?    Zyprexa patients demonstrated a statistically significant improvement
in certain Y-MRS Individual Item Scores compared with valproate patients:
activity/energy (53% vs. 41%), sleep (69% vs. 45%) and language-thought
disorder (49% vs. 35%).  Changes in other core symptoms of mania as defined
by the Y-MRS Individual Item Scores were similar for the two treatment
groups.




Study Design

The three-week, randomized, parallel, double-blind, acute-phase study

examined 251 hospitalized patients at 44 sites who met the DSM-IV criteria

for a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and were experiencing acute manic or

mixed episodes. Subjects received olanzapine in a flexible dose range of 5

to 20 mg/day (once daily) or valproate in a flexible does range of 500 to

2,500  mg/day (multiple doses per day). The mean ending dose for Zyprexa

was 17 mg/day and the mean ending dose for valproate was 1500 mg/day. In

addition, plasma levels were monitored to ensure valproate trough levels

were maintained within the targeted therapeutic range of 50-125 ?g/mL; the

mean value of all levels obtained was 79.4 ?g/mL. Clinicians determined

dosing based on each patient's clinical response as well as the blood

levels in patients taking valproate. Lorazepam use was restricted to a

maximum dose of 2 mg/day, and administration was prohibited within eight

hours of a psychiatric exam.



Additional Study Results

Neither Zyprexa nor valproate induced depressive symptoms in bipolar manic

or mixed patients.  In fact, both Zyprexa and valproate patients showed an

improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression

Rating Scale (HAMD-21).  However, Zyprexa patients showed greater

improvement at the study endpoint in HAMD-21 scores (35% vs. 24%).  The

effects of Zyprexa have not yet been studied in bipolar depression.



Zyprexa was generally well tolerated. The most common and significantly

different adverse events for Zyprexa were somnolence (39.2% vs. 20.6% for

valproate), dry mouth (33.6% vs. 6.3%), and increased appetite (12.0% vs.

2.4%).  The most common adverse event for valproate was nausea (28.6% vs.

10.4% for Zyprexa). Additional safety information for Zyprexa and valproate

can be obtained from their package inserts.



"These data support the value of Zyprexa as a much needed treatment

option," said Mauricio Tohen, M.D., Dr. P.H., medical adviser, Lilly

Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, and lead investigator for the

study.  "The findings provide further evidence that Zyprexa effectively

stabilizes mood in patients with bipolar disorder."



Manic symptoms occur during the manic phase of bipolar disorder, a lifelong

illness characterized by disruptive swings in mood.  Symptoms include

abnormal elation and/or irritability, often accompanied by an unrealistic

belief in one's own abilities, increased sex drive, delusions and alcohol

or drug abuse.  People with bipolar disorder also may experience mixed

episodes, marked by symptoms of mania and clinical depression occurring

simultaneously. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,

Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).  American Psychiatric Association, 1994.


Zyprexa (olanzapine, Lilly)
valproate (Depakote, Abbott)


The study findings are particularly pertinent in light of valproate's

recent revised black box warning from the Food and Drug Administration

following reports of life-threatening pancreatitis in both children and

adults.



"Physicians have good reason to take these new data into account," said

Carlos A. Zarate, M.D., associate professor of psychiatry and director,

bipolar and psychotic disorders program, University of Massachusetts

Medical Center.  "The efficacy of Zyprexa coupled with its favorable safety

profile suggest that it may provide a timely treatment alternative for

patients with bipolar disorder."



Zyprexa is indicated in the United States for the management of the

manifestations of psychotic disorders as demonstrated in short-term

clinical trials with schizophrenia patients.  It is also approved for the

short-term treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar

disorder.



In the original schizophrenia registration trials, olanzapine was generally

well tolerated.  However, as with all medications, olanzapine was

associated with some side effects.  In the original six-week, acute-phase

schizophrenia trials, the most common treatment-emergent adverse event

associated with olanzapine was somnolence.  Other common events were

dizziness, weight gain, constipation, akathisia (restlessness), and

postural hypotension.  Modest elevations of prolactin were also seen,

although mean changes from baseline to endpoint were not statistically

significantly different between olanzapine and placebo.  A small number of

patients experienced asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminase; none

of these patients developed jaundice or drug-induced hepatitis.



In short-term (three- and four-week) acute bipolar mania trials, the most

common treatment-emergent adverse event associated with olanzapine was

somnolence.  Other common events were dry mouth, dizziness, asthenia,

constipation, dyspepsia, increased appetite, and tremor.

Several, months ago Limas Jefferson wrote you a letter requesting your 
support for business opportunities at Enron.  That letter was subsequently 
forwarded to Cindy Olson and me.  As you can see from the note below, we were 
able to arrange for Jefferson & Associations to partner with Compaq on the 
Windows 2000 Project.  You commented on Mr Jefferson's letter that you would 
consider meeting with him.  I can be of assistance in coordinating a meeting 
between the two of you.   Please advise.

FYI - Mr. Jefferson had a difficult time reaching me because my phone number 
changed when my office moved to 3AC.

Calvin,

I just wish to report that starting tomorrow JEFFERSON will supply the third
person to Compaq in support of the Enron Windows 2000 project.  I called you
almost everyday when we were not getting a response, so it is only fair that
you also share in the good news.  Also, thank you for all your support in
making this occasion possible.

You are a good man!

Please stay in touch.

Limas






Good morning -

I was out during the timeframe that this was sent, but Ken Lay did not give 
it back to us.  He is traveling now and totally inaccessible (on vacation) 
during the time of the meeting, so he will not be participating.

Subject: Attached paper and September 27 Panel Meeting


Dear  Ken,

 I am sorry to say that earlier this week Arthur Levitt was called to
testify in Congress early on September 28, and he felt unable to make our
session as originally planned. It is my hope that we can reschedule with him
prior to -- or in conjunction with -- the final report. For those who may
have changed their schedules to make this meeting because of the chance to
talk to Arthur, I regret the inconvenience.

 In deference to your time, we'll go ahead with the meeting from 5 to
7 but not with the dinner.

 Here are the details of the meeting.  Note that the location is
different from the previous two meetings.

     Wednesday, September 27 from 5 to 7
p.m.
     McKinsey & Company
     52 East 52nd Street, 23rd Floor
     New York, NY
     Check in on 23rd floor with Carol
Hubbard, who will direct you to the conference room
Phone: 212-446-8836

 Attached is the draft of our final report, prepared by Tim Koller.
It will be the subject of the meeting.  We will want to gather your comments
on the following:

     1.  Do you agree with the substance
of this draft?
     2.  Are there points that should
receive more or less emphasis?
     3.  Are there any other issues you
would like to raise?
     4.  Is there anything else about the
drafting and presentation that you would
like to comment on?

 We will need to get everyone's comments, one way or another, by the
end of September so we can proceed to prepare the final paper, which we'd
like to have ready by the end of October.

 Originally you said that you would not be able to make the meeting.
Could you let us know if your plans have changed and you can now come or
participate by phone?  See below for reply.

   ____ I will be there

   ____  I will participate by phone

               ____ I cannot make it at all but will
e-mail comments by September 30

 Many thanks,

Good morning, Joe.  Ken is on a cruise, so is not available, but I did talk 
to Steve (he is traveling, but said he is trying to get in touch with you).  
Apparently, everything is still internal.  He said everything is fine, so 
hopefully, you don't need to be concerned.

Talk to you soon.

Subject: Selection Of My Successor-My Concern

Ken: I have "heard" from two sources in this office that Enron will announce 
my successor today. I have not been advised of the selection and am concerned 
that this announcement will not treat my retirement in an appropriate and 
deserving manner.

I have placed calls to Steve Kean since hearing this rumor but have not 
received a response as of now. Admittedl, our phone service because of the 
office construction is not totally functioning.

Frankly, I think this matter has not been handled in a caring way and I have 
been acccused of giving information on the selection to Tom DeLay which is 
untrue. My office mates are all more aware of the candidates and their status 
than I have been.

I regret having to contact you on this matter but feel that despite my total 
cooperation, allegiance and dedication to Enron, I am not being treated with 
the courtesy and sensitivity that this matter deserves.

Joe

Good morning, Michael.  Will there be enough funds to help Sue without 
Shell's if I wait until Mr. Lay returns on October 3?  I have not been very 
successful getting faxes through to the ship, so would prefer not to have to 
bother him with this unless absolutely necessary.

Subject: Referendum Campaign


Mr. Lay--

I have been assisting John Watson with his representation of Sports
Facilities, L.P., and I am in the process of coordinating the $1.4 million
prepayment by the Sports Authority and the contribution of such amount by
the partners to the referendum campaign.

Assuming that we receive the prepayment from the Sports Authority, we expect
to be able to start making contributions to the referendum campaign this
week.  The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign by the
partnership, on behalf of each partner, upon receipt of instructions from
each such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributed
to the campaign instead of being distributed.  I have discussed this
procedure with Sue Walden.

With respect to your arrangement with Shell, we were not sure what you and
Shell had agreed to.  The monies being contributed to the referendum
campaign are being contributed to a special purpose political action
committee (as required by law).  This special purpose PAC is subject to the
general Texas laws that govern campaign fundraising.  As you know, one of
these laws provides that "a person may not knowingly make or authorize a
political contribution in the name of or on behalf of another unless the
person discloses in writing to the recipient the name and address of the
person actually making the contribution . . . ."   Pending a better
understanding of the Shell arrangement, we will hold Shell's $100,000 in the
partnership's account.

Please contact John Watson at 713-758-2556 or me at 713-758-2350 if you have
any questions regarding the foregoing.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Telle

     RPI TO INITIATE PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS ON ANTI-HEPATITIS C DRUG

BOULDER,  Colorado  -  September  28,  2000: Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(RPI)  (NASDAQ:RZYM)  today announced that it has repurchased its rights to
Heptazyme?  from  Eli Lilly and Company and will initiate Phase II clinical
trials  as  soon  as  possible  for  the Anti-Hepatitis C ribozyme to study
dose-ranging  and  biological  markers  of  the  drug's efficacy in chronic
Hepatitis C patients.

Earlier  this month, RPI and Eli Lilly and Company completed a 28 day study
of Heptazyme (LY466700) following daily subcutaneous injections that showed
successful  safety,  tolerability  and pharmacokinetics.  The next phase of
clinical trials will examine the safety and efficacy of Heptazyme alone, at
higher  doses  than  used  in  previous  studies,  and  in combination with
interferon,  a  current  treatment  for  patients  with  Hepatitis C  virus
infection.

Lilly has directed the clinical trials for the Anti-Hepatitis C ribozyme to
date   under   a   licensing   agreement  between  the  parties.   Ribozyme
Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.  has now renegotiated the global rights to Heptazyme
and  will  direct  all  subsequent  clinical trials.  The Phase II trial is
expected to begin in the first quarter of 2001.

"We  are  pleased  to  be  able  to repurchase Heptazyme rights and to have
resources  to  develop  it aggressively," said Ralph E. Christoffersen, CEO
and  President  of RPI.  "We are committed to address the need for improved
therapies  for  HCV,  and  plan  to  move forward as quickly as feasible in
Heptazyme's development."

Ribozymes   are  the  product  of  Nobel  Prize  winning  science  and  are
synthetically engineered to act as "molecular scissors" capable of cleaving
target RNA in a highly specific manner.

RPI (www.rpi.com), located in Boulder, Colorado, is the acknowledged leader
in ribozyme therapeutic development.  RPI has recently announced a ribozyme
commercial  development  program  to develop a ribozyme therapeutic against
Hepatitis  B.  RPI is partnered with Chiron Corporation for the development
and  commercialization  of ANGIOZYME?, an anti-angiogenic ribozyme designed
to  inhibit  the  growth  of new blood supplies to tumors and prevent tumor
growth  and  metastasis.   ANGIOZYME  is  in  Phase I/II clinical trials in
cancer  patients  at  the  Cleveland Clinic.  RPI is also partnered with an
affiliate  of Elan Corporation plc for development and commercialization of
HERZYME?, an anti-HER-2 ribozyme for treatment of breast and other cancers,
through RPI's subsidiary Medizyme Pharmaceuticals Ltd.

RPI  will  have  a Live Webcast regarding this information today at 3:00 pm
MDT.  This webcast can be accessed through the RPI website (www.rpi.com) in
the Investor Relations section.


This  press  release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks
and  uncertainties,  and  actual  events  or results may differ materially.
These   risk   factors   include   actions   by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug
Administration,   technological  advances,  ability  to  obtain  rights  to
technology, ability to obtain and enforce patents, ability to commercialize
and  manufacture  products  and  general  economic  conditions.  These  and
additional  risk  factors  are  identified  in  RPI Securities and Exchange
Commission  filings,  including  the  Forms  10-K and 10-Q and in other SEC
filings.



Hi Michael -

Mr. Lay is returning from his trip today.  He will be in the office tomorrow.

Subject: Referendum Campaign


Mr. Lay--

During the negotiations with the Rockets as to how much each party would
contribute to the Arena referendum campaign, Mike Goldberg of Baker & Botts
suggested that the Rockets would like to net their contribution obligation
against other contributions that they solicited.

After a conversation with you, John Watson and I advised Mike Goldberg that
you did not want to be competing with the Rockets in soliciting
contributions to the Arena referendum campaign.

Mike Goldberg called Friday and asked whether it would be acceptable for the
Rockets to net against their contribution obligation contributions that they
have solicited from Baker & Botts, Jim MacInvale and Tilman Fertitta.  Mike
suggested that these three persons would be the only outside persons that
would be solicited by the Rockets.

Would you please let me know if this is acceptable to you.  You or Rosalee
may call me at 713-758-2350 or send me a response e-mail at
mtelle@velaw.com.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Telle


This is a reminder of your ongoing obligation to report to the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") transactions in Lilly stock.  In light of
the complexity of the reporting rules and the potential for severe
penalties for noncompliance, please contact me in advance of any
transaction.  As a reminder, the SEC rules cover all transactions,
including:

-   purchases
-   sales
-   gifts
-   trust or partnership transactions
-   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
-   exchange fund transactions

We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two
reasons:

   There are certain times when you should not engage in market
   transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these "black-outs" occur around
   the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
   announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of "inside
   information" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our
   reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.
   While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to
   you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have
   legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.

2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.

If you had any Lilly stock transactions in September, please advise me as
soon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature
and file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").  The
reports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day
of the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am
not available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any
proposed transaction.

If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate
to call me.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Since you left for India, and in case I forget to tell you, I asked to have a 
new banking rep to replace Howard Williams for LPL Prop & Interiors.  Since I 
was doing this, both Sally and Sherrie felt it best to have all of our 
business with one person rather than dealing with two.  So, we will now be 
dealing with Margaret Barradas who is Howard's superior.  Where James Shelton 
was a hard act to follow, Howard should be a piece of cake.  Anyone merely 
pleasant and respectful would be an upgrade to Howard and hopefully our new 
rep will fill the bill.   Love, L.

Memorandum

To GOP Activists
Fr Ken Hutcheson
Re George W. Bush Debate Win/Al Gore's Lies

I hope you got a chance to see the debate last night.  George W. Bush did a
very good job articulating his message and debating Al Gore.

I am sure it will come as no surprise to you that Al Gore could not go the
entire debate without telling a lie.  In fact, two lies have been exposed so
far.

The first one was Gore's claim that he visited Texas with FEMA Director,
James Lee Witt, after the bad Texas floods and tornadoes.  As it turns out,
that was a lie.  Al Gore on the morning news shows today claimed that he
thought he had, but it must have been another state.  Go figure.

The next lie exposed is as follows:

News radio 970 WFLA interviewed the principal of Sarasota High this morning.
He said that the girl that Gore was talking about had no desk for exactly
one day.  It was the first day of class and they were still making
adjustments to the kids class schedule and that particular classroom was
being refurbished.  The teacher only had to call the office and get her a
desk because they have plenty of desks there.  Apparently there is a picture
that was sent to Gore of her standing in class or something like that
because the Principal mentions that in the picture of her there is $100,000
of new equipment behind her.

Please pass this along to your friends and family and any undecided voters.
The more people who realize that Al Gore is a pathological liar, the better
George W. Bush will do.

Please check out the two links and cast your vote for George W. Bush as the
winner in last night's debate:  http://news.excite.com/news/poll/ or
http://www.cnn.com/

Last but not least....Have you done everything you can do to elect George W.
Bush?  Have you made a small contribution to Victory 2000?  Have you
participated in a literature drop for the GOP Ticket or made phone calls on
its behalf?  If not, please let me know.

Thanks for your support.

Mr. Chairman,
?
Archer's ex son in law is contacting him to see if  he do a spot similar to 
what the President did for us in 1996. We can cut the  spot at Archer's 
convenience and he will have total script approval,  obviously.
?
I am preparing a poll memorandum showing that this  will not kill him with 
Republicans, especially younger Republicans, so he has  nothing to fear.
?
I will also send him a copy of the President's spot  from '96.
?
I understand that Jordan is trying to contact  Archer also.
?
Anything that you could do to encourage Archer to  consider this will be of 
great help. We didn't poll on Archer...but I know his  support will have a 
tremendous impact on the Westside and we need  that.
?

Subject: Referendum Campaign


Mr. Lay--

During the negotiations with the Rockets as to how much each party would
contribute to the Arena referendum campaign, Mike Goldberg of Baker & Botts
suggested that the Rockets would like to net their contribution obligation
against other contributions that they solicited.

After a conversation with you, John Watson and I advised Mike Goldberg that
you did not want to be competing with the Rockets in soliciting
contributions to the Arena referendum campaign.

Mike Goldberg called Friday and asked whether it would be acceptable for the
Rockets to net against their contribution obligation contributions that they
have solicited from Baker & Botts, Jim MacInvale and Tilman Fertitta.  Mike
suggested that these three persons would be the only outside persons that
would be solicited by the Rockets.

Would you please let me know if this is acceptable to you.  You or Rosalee
may call me at 713-758-2350 or send me a response e-mail at
mtelle@velaw.com.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Telle


Ken will attend both meetings.

Subject: Final items of the MC



Hello John,
I hope you have returned to normal after the MC!!!  I can only say that it
was a tremendous success, and everyone should be congratulated that worked
on the planning!
Now to the final items.  We are billing everyone for the hotel, golf and
regatta this week and we have a few questions.  The hotel and golf are easy.
However the regatta is a different situation.  When we started this project,
the cost of the regatta was much less than when we finished.  We quoted
$85.00 per person, however the Millennium rate was actually $100.00 per
person.  This would not be such a great problem, however we had 33 no-shows
for the regatta.  This being said, we have two choices.  We bill those that
sailed for an additional $15.00 to make their charge $100.00 which then
leaves us with a negative $3500.00.  Or, we also bill the 33 no-shows for
$100.00 each which puts us pretty close to break even.
In the big picture, there have been some budget cost that were less than
expected and some that were more.  We will have the final budget complete by
the end of next week.
The most important issue, is it acceptable to bill those that sailed $100.00
or do you want us to stay at the original price of $85.00?......Then, of
course, what should we do about the no shows?  Possibly bill them a
cancellation fee or the full fee?  Or, forget and forgive this time?
I am leaving for Paradise tomorrow, however my trusted partner Janelle will
be here until the 20th of January.  We would like to get everything
finalized before she leaves.
Give us your thoughts.

The EX-MC Director

2)   The Kyoto Conference(COP3) defined an international framework
for dealing with the issue of global warming.
(The GHG reduction targets contained in the Kyoto Protocol are 6%
for Japan, 7% for the U.S.A., 8% for the EU)
Specific content for the Flexibility Mechanism/Kyoto Mechanism
(for International Emissions Trading (IET), Joint Implement (JI),
and Clean Development Mechanism(CDM)) will be decided on at COP6,
which is scheduled for November 2000.
     GHG is a serious matter requiring a globally studying.

2. GHG Reduction
1)   The relationship between GHG levels and climatic change
remains uncertain at present and further research is required.
Policies will have to be devised that take account of developments
in scientific knowledge and opinion and that also maintains
flexibility.
2)   Policy on GHG reduction must reflect the circumstances of
each country and be based on a combination of regulatory measures,
economic measures and voluntary measures.
     Excessive regulating may cause the unfairness in business
competition.

3. Energy Conservation
1)   The U.S.A. is the largest consumer of energy. In such a
large, mobile country, much
consumption is accounted for by the transportation sector.
2)   The EU has pushed many advances in environmental protection,
and has seen considerable progress in the use of renewable energy.

3)   Japan has very limited natural resources, and energy
conservation has been promoted since the oil shocks of the 1970s.
As a result, Japan is a leader in making effective use of energy,
and has the lowest level of GHG emissions against GDP.
Japan's policy is to combine regulation with voluntary measures.
Industry has supported this by promoting voluntary environmental
plans and other measures.
Japanese industries including Toshiba are to improve the energy
consumption efficiency of their products and use of energy at
their factories.

4. Programme of Industry
1)   Energy conservation is to make up the cost reduction of
products and recycling will bring about the effect on manufacturing
cost saving in the long run.

Attached file is a memo from our pollster on  Republicans should you talk to 
Bill  Archer.

?

Channel 2 did a poll story on Thursday  which shows the Arena with a 19 or 20 
point lead. It was their poll. Our  latest show about the same.

Subject: Meeting with SM Krishna, CM of Karanataka in Davos as per his letter 
to Dr. Lay

Dear Ken: 

As discussed I would appreciate your meeting with the CM even for a few 
minutes at Davos. I will find soem time in ur schedule to brief you for that 
meeting before you leave for Davos.

The CM considers u as a personal friend now that u have arranged for him to 
be invited to Davos. In fact he has also requested you personally whether you 
can arrange a meeting with Bill Gates while he is there. That would probably 
be impossible given everyone's schedule there and my message for that to the 
CM is going to be that eaxctly that... the schedules look impossible to 
arrange that.

However for your meeting, I would appreciate giving us some time.

Regards,
Sanjay


Dad,
We are not going to go to D.C. on the 16th as Jose
Luis needs to be back here for meetings on the 16th.
This just came up. He would like to meet with Lynn
Coleman at some time, but it may neet to wait until
later this month (depending on how things go this
Friday).
I hope you guys had a good time in Palm Beach. Houston
is FREEZING! Now we have perfect weather in Florida,
though with hight of only 78!
I'll see you this weekend.
Love,
Elizabeth

Hi Liz -

Will you please give your Dad a call at the office at your earliest 
convenience.

Rosie
Attached file contains two additional economic  points to highlight to the 
board.
?
Please give to Mr. Lay before the 2:30 meeting  today.
Hi Liz -

The reason Ken and Linda were trying to reach you from the plane was that 
they had some suggestions for the hotel rooms and wanted you to know their 
preference.  They would like to give the Jasmine Suite that they are 
currently in to the Vittors with a connecting bedroom, to take care of their 
family.

They would like Mark and Natalie to have the end or corner suite that the 
Vittors have.

Ken and Linda said that they would prefer two connecting rooms, hopefully on 
the 3rd or 4th floor.  They would like for the rooms to have the ocean view 
on the North side.  If that isn't possible, it would be o.k. to overlook the 
pool, but they would not really like the south side as it wouldn't be as 
quiet.  The two rooms would give them everything they need, with 2 baths.

They said they can be reached in Switzerland tomorrow.  The Hotel Meierhof's 
phone number is:  41-81-416-82-85, Fax is:  41-81-416-39-82.  They should 
arrive in Davos about 9:00 a.m.

I know you will have a beautiful and wonderful wedding!!  Thank you so much 
for including me on the Save the Date list.  I feel honored!  Unfortunately, 
we won't be able to come.   Our "first" anniversary is June 3, but was 1961!!

Take care and call if we can do anything.

Subject: Milken Institute Conference Sponsorship



Ken,

I hope all is going well at Enron.  I know you and/or your people have been
discussing with Glenn Yago our so-called Emerging Domestic Markets Project.
It is an exciting one and we look forward to Enron's support, involvement,
participation and leadership.  Glenn will be in touch as the project
unfolds.

Now I am contacting you about our upcoming Global Conference, March 8-10,
2000 in Los Angeles.  There are two issues.

First, I am sure you are aware, we are holding our third annual Milken
Institute Global Conference March 8-10, 2000 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in
Los Angeles. A copy of the program is attached. This year's event will have
a heavy contingent of institutional investors, corporate leaders, and
technology, media and policy people in the audience.  On the program, we
have nine Nobel Laureates, several CEOs of major corporations, and other
heavy hitters.  As you can see, there is a major technology slant to this
year's program.  It will be a great event.  We would love to have some
representation from Enron in the audience.

Second, we are still accepting corporate sponsorship for the event.  I have
attached a copy of our Sponsorship Opportunities brochure that describes the
various levels ($10K - $100K), and the benefits of each sponsorship tier.
This is a great program to be associated with - both high-quality speakers
and a prestigious audience.  Mike Milken and I hope to be able to count on
your organization for support.

We anticipate a global audience of 1,500 - senior people from the financial
sector, business, technology, academia, the policy community and all the
major media.  In just two years, our Global Conference has become a
significant and influential gathering for discussion, debate and networking
on key business, economic, financial and policy questions.

I hope we can count on you.

I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this is a hoax:

http://urbanlegends.about.com/culture/urbanlegends/library/blemtax2.htm

Here's an excerpt from the U.S. Postal Service's published response:

A completely false rumor concerning the U.S. Postal Service is being
circulated over the Internet via e-mail.
The e-mail message claims that a "Congressman Schnell" has introduced "Bill
602P" to allow the federal government to impose a 5-cent surcharge on each
e-mail message delivered over the Internet. The money would be collected by
Internet Service Providers and then turned over to the Postal Service.

No such proposed legislation exists. In fact, no "Congressman Schnell"
exists.

The Chronicle is developing a front page story  based on a Garnett Coleman 
idea to change state law to allow Sports Authority  tax funds to go to fund 
public hospitals.
?
It is my judgement that this story and the spin  afterwards could easily 
shave 10 points off our yes #'s and make this a  horserace again.
?
It is even worse than the stealth tax increase in  '96 because it cuts to the 
heart of voters' objections to the funding of sports  facilities. And it 
takes away our reponse that this money cannot legally ever be  used to fund 
hospitals or education. This was the basis of their successful  attack in 
'99---only this time we don't have any real response.
?
The Chronicle has delayed this story for  one day.
?
I won't waste your time reviewing the various  things we have done to spin 
this better. We have done many things. But it is  like putting bandaids on a 
gaping chest wound.
?
Could you call Jack Loftis or Sweeney at  the Chronicle? We need to downplay 
it or kill it. I have more info if you want to  talk---713-851-2576.

There will be news on this subject soon that could  make the Rockets payments 
to the city look very paltry without some good spin.  Since you did the Enron 
Deal, I wanted to give you a heads up and some talking  points which I will 
have for you Monday. I think the news will keep until  then.

Dad,
I've drafted a Interim Construction Financing document
for the loan we previously discussed. However, I would
like to have it reviewed by Elizabeth Labonowski
(assuming she has handled some of your loans and real
estate interests previously) if you don't mind.
Unfortunately, since my contract experience is
generally in Take or Pay or join venture projects, it
is lengthier than you wanted.
Please let me know if I can have the go ahead to
contact Elizabeth and if you could have Rosalee send
me Elizabeth's e-mail address, that would be very
helpful.
Thanks,
Love,
Elizabeth

Hi John -

Ken said that given he will be in town on March 15, he will plan to attend 
the meeting also. By way of this e-mail, I'll check with Joe's office to see 
what time it's scheduled.

Thanks.

Rosie

Subject: Prospective Meeting with Jim Harmon, Chairman of EXIMBank, March 15


Ken and Joe
 Jim Harmon, Chairman of EXIMBank will be in Houston March 15 and would like 
to meet with Enron to see where there are opportunities for EXIM to work more 
closely with the company.  He will be accompanied by Jeff Miller VP who 
oversees the finance operations and perhaps Barabara O"Boyle, head of the 
project finance group.  As you know we have done little with the Bank since 
Trakya. We intended to use the Bank for Dabhol 2 but were prevented to by 
sanctions imposed against India.  Joe is now on the EXIM Advisory Committee 
so it would be a good opportunity to sit down with the Bank. 
 I understand that Ken has received a letter from EXIM about the meeting and 
referred it to Joe.  I would propose that Joe lead the meeting with some of 
the regional finance people (parallel the Munoz schedule, but shorter) with a 
brief courtesy call on Ken or Ken could step in for a moment whenever he is 
available.
 I will check with Pam re Joe's availability and follow up with a memo re the 
market window initiative with EXIM where my office is heavily involved.


There will not be an  Executive Committee Meeting on Monday, October 23.
Dolores, this is the call to Ken that we talked about.   I appreciate Mark=

Hi Rebecca -

In fact, the Consul General of Ghana, Jack Webb, has called Ken asking him to 
meet with the Ambassador to Ghana March 10 or 11 when he will be in Houston.  
I had put a message on Ken's messages last evening asking if you could handle 
this if you are available, so hopefully he will say yes - especially after he 
sees your message.

Rosie

Subject: Ghana

Ken.

I wanted to get back with regarding your question of Ghana.  You might 
remember that Ralph Hodge had indicated to you that you may well be hearing 
from the Ghanaian Ambassador.  Ralph believes that he will try to facilitate 
a meeting between you and Chevron.

We have been working Ghana pretty hard, including the West African Gas 
Pipeline, the Effasu Power Project, a marketing company and a host of other 
possibilities.  We have told the Ghanaians that with what is going on right 
now in Nigeria, the loss of projects in Cote d'Ivoire due to the coup d'etat, 
and the lack of speed in moving forward in Ghana , that we are slowing down a 
bit to determine if we can resolve current projects before taking on 
additional ones.  

Clearly this is a bit of a "cop out".  I am reluctant to tell Ghana that we 
are slowing down generally in Africa because I don't want to hurt the barge 
deal or jepordize the possible resolution of the large snowball in Mozambique 
and there is truth to the Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria issues.  And, of course, 
I don't want to alienate Ghana generally.  I have a good relationship with 
the Ambassador from Ghana, in fact, I just got a postcard from him two days 
ago, and when he returns to the US he has indicated that he will call me.  I 
will deliver this message, hopefully diverting the call to you.  If he does 
get to you first, he won't be upset for you to send him on to me, I don't 
believe.

If there is any clarification, please give me a holler.  I hope the office 
opening has gone well.  I've extracted many a promise from participants to 
drink a pint for me.

Regards
Rebecca

THERE WILL NOT BE AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEETING ON MONDAY, OCTOBER 30
Rep. Archer did a great job today filming the spot.  Fyi, we will put it up 
on Thursday and hold a news conference that same day with  four Republican 
state reps and preview the spot for TV and the  chronicle.
?
Would you send Archer a short note thanking  him, Sharon and Don Carlson, his 
aide, for their excellent  effort?
?
Thanks. Everything is good. Our four day tracking  poll (we are tracking 
every night except friday and saturday) shows us  up 59-34. Give the 
opponents all the undecided and we are still in  shape to coast in 55-45--a 
20 point turnaround from  '99.
Sue asked me to send following  information:
?
Sylvia will hold a news conference on Tuesday to  endorse the arena. The 
press advisory sent out today will cause many of them to  think she is going 
to oppose the arena. That's good because more of the media  will show up.
?
Her basic statement will be to reinforce her  position, as the city's fiscal 
watchdog, that this will not take one dime away  from basic services and will 
indeed help the city keep growing and thus have  more funding for city 
services---especially the $13 million a  year that the Arena will generate in 
sales taxes and the increase in property  values downtown.
?
It will be great if Mr. Lay could show up at the  event and that Sylvia for 
her support and objective analysis of the arena  benefits.
Mr. Platt -

Ken Lay said that he will approve the $10,000 underwriter costs to be one of 
the five sponsors for the media briefing on March 14.  Mr. Lay has asked me 
to see if Joe Sutton, the Vice Chairman of Enron, might be able to attend.  I 
will pass the information on to him.

Please ask Mr. Radtke to send an invoice to Enron, unless there is some 
better way to handle getting the money to you.

Flash.

Hotze just bought TV. Looks like 125k total  for one week. Not certain. 
Cannot tell about complete buy since it isn't in the  public file.
?
Spot will run on 11 at 5,6, 10 news and  some on Letterman. 
?
Will consider response if spot seems to be  good. Tracking polls will follow.
?
I am putting Archer on Thursday ahead of  schedule to counter.
?
Will  advise.
Rebecca,  I just talked to Ken and asked him again.  He said that there had 
been a couple of developments while he was in London, so he wanted to wait 
until he gets back to the office and has a chance to talk to you.  He will be 
in the office on Thursday.

Thanks.

Hi Rosalee-- I just wanted to thank you so much for your extra help on our
inquiry to Ken.  We understand completely that the April 25 slot following
his return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's
always easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given recently
can easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of
my previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May to
the World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we
would work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new
content.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I
mentioned the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when it
comes to the idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy markets
and business enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and
don't hesitate to ever ask for a "quid pro quo" from us.

They've told the stations that they expect to add time to the buy. But that
will be very difficult for them to do next week and it will not be all that
much any way.

Our in-house media guy says the TV is being placed by the Carson Group. The

Well, I know this is terribly short notice, but Ken does have a meeting with 
Tom DeLay on Monday morning at 9:30 a.m.  (I know that's half a day gone for 
Joe if he's in town), but he is coming in to discuss RMIC (Republican 
Majority Issues Committee).  Are there specific things that Ken needs to be 
briefed on?  I know that Steve did recommend that Ken have this meeting.

Thanks very much.

Subject: Duchess of Northumbria's request

Ken

Thanks for sending me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help 
with her garden project.  I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our 
view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this, we 
should say a polite "no".

The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O'Neill, 
Managing Director of Lurgi Invent.

Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really 
is difficult to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work 
for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.  However, this 
business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see 
any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent.

Given the nature of the project, the approach from the Duchess and the fact 
that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself, we really do believe no is 
the right answer.

Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to 
correspond direct with the Duchess.

Best wishes.

Colin

Subject: Duchess of Northumbria's request

Ken

Thanks for sending me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help 
with her garden project.  I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our 
view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this, we 
should say a polite "no".

The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O'Neill, 
Managing Director of Lurgi Invent.

Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really 
is difficult to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work 
for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.  However, this 
business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see 
any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent.

Given the nature of the project, the approach from the Duchess and the fact 
that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself, we really do believe no is 
the right answer.

Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to 
correspond direct with the Duchess.

Best wishes.

Colin

Subject: rockets season has begun


Hello dear siblings... yes, believe it or not, I  am sending one of my rare 
e-mails.?
?
I will be in charge of distributing Rocket  tickets this season for mom and 
Ken?since I successfully accomplished  baseball ticket distribution without 
having a nervous breakdown.? You all  were actually wonderful and made it 
very easy due to the rules that were set  up by the folks prior to my 
receiving that responsibility.? Organization  comes natural to me so I am 
happy to do it again so that mom has one less  thing on her plate.
?
Rules have not yet been sent out by mom and  Ken,?but I do want to get a jump 
start on the season distribution since  it is upon us already.? With 
baseball, all ticket were requested prior to  the 1st of each month, so that 
I was able to commit game tickets to family and  then to Mom and Ken's 
significant other people for that  given?month.? Tickets were requested and 
guaranteed one  month?at a time?not further out?than that.? There was also  
some sort of first come first serve rule?which I don't fully remember but  it 
also never became a problem.??All of these rules made it  work?so I suggest 
sticking to them  again?regarding?basketball.??(Mom and Ken?may null  and 
void all of this with new rules but these are my suggestions until they do  
so.)
?
There are 4 tickets grouped together on row 1 and  an additional 4 tickets 
grouped together on row 2.? So, this year we have  the pleasure of an 
additional 4 tickets at each game which should make the  rubics cube of 
ticket distribution a bit easier.
?
November games include:
?
Thursday??? ???  Nov.2?????? ?? 7:30  pm??? Milwaukee
Tuesday??? ???  ?Nov.7???????? 7:30  pm??? Los Angeles
Thursday??? ???  Nov.9?????? ?? 7:30  pm??? Vancover
Tuesday????  ??? Nov.14????????7:30  pm????Chicago
Thursday??????  Nov.16??? ??? 7:30 pm???  Charlotte
Saturday??? ???  Nov.18??? ??? 7:30 pm???  Pheonix
Tuesday??????  ? Nov. 28???????7:30  pm??? Sacramento
?
Please let me know ASAP what your requests are  for the month of November and 
I will do my best to try and make everyone  happy.? This needs to be resolved 
by friday of this week  Nov.3rd so that I am able to distribute to family and 
then start  making calls down the list of mom and Ken's significant other 
people so that  all tickets are used.? If you have not contacted me by friday 
with your  requests, I will distribute tickets so no whining is allowed if 
you don't get  what you later realize you want.? Remember FRIDAY IS THE 
DEADLINE FOR THE  MONTH OF NOVEMBER.
?
Regarding December, get your requests in now  which will be final and tickets 
will be distributed to everyone by  friday the?1st of December.
No tickets will go unused.
?
December games include:
?
Saturday??? ??? Dec  2??????????7:30  pm??? Portland
Tuesday???  ???? Dec  5??????????7:30  pm??? Dallas
Saturday??? ??? Dec  16??? ??? 7:30 pm???  Denver
Tuesday???????  ?Dec 19??? ??? 7:30 pm???  San Antonio
Thursday??? ??? Dec  21??? ??? 7:30 pm??? Los  Angeles
Saturday??? ??? Dec  23??? ??? 7:30 pm??? Golden  State
Wednesday???Dec  27??? ??? 7:30 pm???  Seattle
?
Best way to get me is by fax 713 629  5755 since I am at home with the wee 
precious ones.? I receive  faxes?instantly.? For those of you that are hipper 
than me and like  email, that is another option but?it takes a maximum?of 24 
hours for  me to receive your messages since Christophe takes the computer to 
and from  work everyday.
?
I hope everyone is doing well and HAPPY  HALLOWEEN!!!

Subject: Jeff Skilling does MS150




	

Well, the bike is inspected, a few training rides have been made, and the 
camping gear is being dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the 
fairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, 
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff 
Skilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS.

Enron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over 
350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the 
Enron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am 
challenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain 
amount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a 
break on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's 
closer to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat 
pledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge 
to this very worthy cause 1-1.

I hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top 
money raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your 
consideration.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.

The ch 2 survey had a wider spread but I don't  think it is accurate (63-36).

The Chronicle will be calling tomorrow with their  poll numbers. Their poll 
is a creation of Dick Murray and Bob Stein. I would  expect them to show us 
in a much tighter race. These guys are not always  accurate (remember their 
60-40 against poll on baseball in '96).

Attached for your information is the letter to shareholders that Sidney

call me.

 - ST Election Letter.pdf
This is a reminder of your ongoing obligation to report to the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") transactions in Lilly stock.  In light of
the complexity of the reporting rules and the potential for severe
penalties for noncompliance, please contact me in advance of any
transaction.  As a reminder, the SEC rules cover all transactions,
including:

-   purchases
-   sales
-   gifts
-   trust or partnership transactions
-   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
-   exchange fund transactions

We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two
reasons:

   There are certain times when you should not engage in market
   transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these "black-outs" occur around
   the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
   announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of "inside
   information" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our
   reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.
   While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to
   you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have
   legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.

2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.

If you had any Lilly stock transactions in October, please advise me as
soon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature
and file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").  The
reports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day
of the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am
not available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any
proposed transaction.

If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate
to call me.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Hi Terry -

Ken Lay said that he would really like an update and more detail about the 
"Digital Divide" and TFA.  He is attending the Fortune Battle Royal and said 
this fits right in with the subject.  He will be leaving for Washington 
tomorrow night.

Thanks.

Dear Ken:

Night before last I visited with President and Mrs. Bush and suggested that he
give you a call regarding TFA (Technology For All)! I told him that it might
prove valuable for his son's campaign!  When we spoke with Cynthia Sandherr in
Washington a week or so ago, she said that the "Digital Divide" was the 
hottest
topic on Capital Hill.  She had some wonderful ideas on how to spin this so 
that
businesses create the bridge for the divide and not government!  Although we
want to stay nonpartisan with TFA, this would be a wonderful press opportunity
and platform in Washington!

Just thought I should give you "heads-up" in case he asks and please tell 
Linda
I said hello!

Thank you for doing so much for the cause!

Dear Friends and Family,
We are down to the wire and the race couldn't be
closer. Every vote counts, even those of you in Texas.
Please, remember to vote and go early, polls open at
7am across the country and close at 7pm but don't put
it off until 7pm as there could be lines and the
supervisors are not required to keep the polls open
after 7pm for those in line.
Remind your friends and family to vote and if someone
needs transportation to the polls, give them a ride or
call your local Victory 2000 office (Republicans) or
your local Democratic campaign office, they will have
people available to transport people to the polls.
Keep an eye out while you are at the polls for
electoral fraud and report any suspicious activity
including inappropriate campaigning to the poll
watchers at the polls. The Democrats and the
Republicans will have representatives at most of the
polls, let them know if there is suspicious activity.
Finally, if you have time, call your local offices and
offer your time to make phone calls to encourage
people to get out and vote, pass out leaflets, or to
be available to help prevent of voter fraud.

Finally, enjoy the evening and watch the results come
in. There are election watch parties everywhere!!!

Just one more day (and no more mass political e-mail's
from me and everyone else)!
Take care and VOTE!
Liz

I left a message at your home this morning that your Dad would like to speak 
with you when you have a chance to call.  

Rosie

p.s. - P. L. and I did early voting the first Saturday available!!  It was 
such a good feeling as Tuesdays are tough with trying to get to the office 
and leave in time to vote!!

Subject: Get out the Vote


Dear Friends and Family,
We are down to the wire and the race couldn't be
closer. Every vote counts, even those of you in Texas.
Please, remember to vote and go early, polls open at
7am across the country and close at 7pm but don't put
it off until 7pm as there could be lines and the
supervisors are not required to keep the polls open
after 7pm for those in line.
Remind your friends and family to vote and if someone
needs transportation to the polls, give them a ride or
call your local Victory 2000 office (Republicans) or
your local Democratic campaign office, they will have
people available to transport people to the polls.
Keep an eye out while you are at the polls for
electoral fraud and report any suspicious activity
including inappropriate campaigning to the poll
watchers at the polls. The Democrats and the
Republicans will have representatives at most of the
polls, let them know if there is suspicious activity.
Finally, if you have time, call your local offices and
offer your time to make phone calls to encourage
people to get out and vote, pass out leaflets, or to
be available to help prevent of voter fraud.

Finally, enjoy the evening and watch the results come
in. There are election watch parties everywhere!!!

Just one more day (and no more mass political e-mail's
from me and everyone else)!
Take care and VOTE!
Liz

Hi Corey -

My champion, hero, angel - I think I have made a major mistake!!!  I thought 
I had tickets to Mark McGuire's team for May 12, but it is the Cinncinatti 
Reds!!!  I am so sorry.  Is that going to be o.k.?  That's  what I get for 
thinking I know anything about baseball.

Look forward to hearing from you!!

Hi Liz -

"Elizabeth -

The Republican Convention is July 31 - August 3.  Although there are no 
guarantees I expect I can get you tickets and reservations.

Love,

Liz, I have sent an e-mail to our Washington office to ask for assistance in 
obtaining hotel reservations and credentials.  We don't yet have reservations 
for Ken as everything is locked up by the Republicans, but I have been 
assured they will be forthcoming.  We asked for the same hotel as your Dad 
will have, so hopefully that will work.

Subject: e-Katz: Chief Kroeker


Over the past week I have heard from many thoughtful and concerned citizens
about their opinions on Chief Kroeker.  About an hour ago, I held a news
conference to release the statement below in response.  I wanted to make
sure you were able to read it in its entirety.

You are a part of my e-Katz list because of your work with me or my
administration.  To be removed from the "e-Katz" distribution list, simply
reply to this e-mail with your request.  If you have multiple e-mail
addresses you use, please include a name and/or company, otherwise we may
not be able to locate the correct entry to remove.  For more information on
the Katz administration, visit our website at
http://www.ci.portland.or.us/mayor.


Statement Regarding Police Chief Mark Kroeker

"I take my responsibilities as police commissioner very seriously.  I have
reviewed this situation with care.  I want to thank those who provided me
feedback either in person, over the telephone or through e-mail.

"The performance of any individual in my administration ultimately rests
with me.  I want to apologize for the concern, pain and fear caused by the
taped comments made years ago by Chief Kroeker.  His taped comments in no
way reflect my own personal beliefs.

"My community and staff discussions, along with reading all the e-mails and
transcripts of all my telephone messages, helped distill my thinking on this
issue to one key question: Can Chief Kroeker separate his personal religious
views from his professional conduct?

"I have determined that he manages his duties without bias and will continue
to do so. His performance has met my expectations.  He is leading the bureau
in a fair, respectful and inclusive manner.  He is moving our law
enforcement efforts to a higher level of community policing.  Therefore, I
have asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief of Police.  He has my strong
support to continue.

"The law provides that all city employees have a right to their personal
religious views.  I have a responsibility to review their employment status
if their actions, as a result of their personal views, impair their ability
to perform their professional responsibilities.

"Many of the arguments raised asking me to dismiss Mark Kroeker because he
is "out of step with Portland" could be used in other Oregon communities to
fire more liberal public officials who are "out of step" with their
community's conservative majority.  My 30-year fight for tolerance goes both
ways.

"Chief Kroeker will have to rebuild trust with many of our citizens.   He
assures me he is prepared to do so.  He told me he would rather help undo
the damage, help me promote tolerance and acceptance of all people, than
just walk away.

"He commits to a strong and sustained positive dialogue with Portlanders who
are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, including those on his staff.
He has already begun outreach efforts and will continue to do so.

"He said he will redouble his efforts to promote respect and acceptance of
all Portlanders and be steadfast and fair in his enforcement of the law.

"He agrees to work with the Cascade Aids Project to serve as a spokesperson
to educate citizens about the fact that AIDS is not a "gay disease."

"He will continue to seek advice from the City Council, the Bureau's Sexual
Minority Roundtable and others to guide additional efforts.

"He agrees to take all this on with all his heart.

"In the process I hope he and we all learn from this experience.  I will
work to turn this negative situation into a positive one: to expand our
sense of tolerance; to promote the notion that regardless of a person's
personal or religious beliefs, one can be an effective public servant; and
to deepen the acceptance of all Portlanders.

"As Mayor, I will do my part and more.  I hope you will join me."

Hey there,

I just called your dad and congratulated the "father of the bride"  He was 
VERY cute and walked me through his conversation with JL and his thoughts on 
Florida...FUN FUN FUN - He is so proud of you and thinks so highly of JL - I 
can hardly wait to meet him.

All my love,
Christina

YIPPEE - what fun...I have one more Florida suggestion - The Boca Beach Club. 
 Here is the pitch.

*    2 easy airport to fly into: Miami and West Palm
*    The BBC compound has 4 hotels and at least five restaurants - with
an amazing tower restaurant - which would we great for a rehearsal dinner
*    The four hotels include:  Condos, tower hotel, old estate rooms, and
beach front rooms.  There is a water shuttle and complementary shuttle - that 
is very convenient to transport people around!
*    Beautiful Ball room
*    2 Golf courses
*    Tons of tennis courts
*    Multiple Pools
*    Gorgeous entrance way


We have stayed there at least ten times and always have a great time.  Just a 
thought!

Dear Family,
Heather and I were talking about NYC and thought we
should make some reservations for dinner for the
entire family on Friday and Saturday night. I am
trying to get reservations for the entire family at Le
Cirque 2000 for Friday night at 7:30 but we will be
very lucky to get in. Does anyone have other
suggestions or an objection to Le Cirque? I am
attaching a review of the restaurant. It is definitely
a little "Haute" but I've heard it is also a lot of
fun. Heather is looking into Italian restaurants for
Saturday night, as well.

This is just a suggestion but we were worried that we
may have difficutly getting into a good restaurant if
we wait too long. Also, I think I am just a little
excited about the trip!
Luv to all
Liz

The Verdict
The highest of the city's high-society restaurants.

Tip Sheet
One of New York's Best
Nominated for best dessert and for best French
restaurant, this aptly-named restaurant provides the
city's most carnivalesque dinner experience.
Can't Wait?
Peruse Le Cirque 2000's blockbuster wine list now.

Also Nominated for Best French Restaurant
Daniel, Chanterelle, Jean Georges, Le Bernardin

Also Nominated for Best Dessert
Gramercy Tavern, Payard Patisserie, Jean Georges, Park
Avenue Cafe

The Scene
Uber-designer Adam Tihany's (Jean Georges, among
others) surreal interior evokes simultaneous thoughts
of the Sistine Chapel and "The Jetsons." Purple,
one-armed velvet chairs, neon tubing and
stainless-steel sculptures compete for attention with
the soaring, gilded ceilings, pre-Raphaelite murals
and bejeweled patrons. Ringleader Sirio Maccioni
oversees a front-of-house that has won praise for
softening the haughty edge that marked the
restaurant's pre-Y2K incarnation.

The Food
Still some of the most sublime haute cuisine around.
Though longtime sous chef Sotta Kuhnn is now heading
the kitchen=01*having succeeded Sylvain Portay (who took
over for Daniel Boulud)=01*the luxurious,
truffle-and-foie-gras-studded fare remains as sharp as
ever. The current menu includes the long-running
paupiette of sea bass with Barolo sauce and leeks, as
well a sauteed veal chop with bacon-wrapped asparagus.
Patrons can take decision-making out of the picture
entirely with the five-course chef's degustation menu,
a bargain at $90.

Hi Mr. Garten and Valerie -

We have been working on Ken's schedule.  It is a fairly busy week, but it 
looks like he could do a 30 minute conference call on Wed. at 2:30 p.m. (New 
York time), if that is still good for you.  Please let me know if Wednesday 
is a satisfactory time for the phone call.  That appears to be the only 
window he has next week.

Valerie had already sent the SEC Panel Outline on 4/11, which you attached 
below.  Ken Lay has already seen it.

Re:  the other question that you asked about Ken Lay's name appearing in a 
press release, he said that is fine.

Dear Ken,

We are in the process of trying to arrange a conference call with you on
either Tuesday or Wednesday of next week to discuss the paper which is
attached.  ( I'm sending it along now so that you have some time to look at
it.)

We will be doing this by conference call and once we set a time to talk with
you, will give you the number to call.  (To set up a time, your office can
contact my assistant, Valerie Petersen either at valerie.petersen@yale.edu
or at 203-432-6035.)

Look forward to speaking with you next week.

Best regards,

in turn, pass it on to whoever they deal with in Maintenance.  It has been at

Gary, 
Least I forget!  On N5737 the other day (11/18) Mr. Lay reported to Bill 
Reddick that when his phone (#2 R/H seat) rings and he answers that it 
disconnects on him.  He told Bill that this is the third time he has reported 
this problem.  I spoke personally with Bill about this.  We checked and there 
is no record of this problem reported recently (we checked back to May 2000) 
on all three Falcon 900's.

Lyndel checked the system and there does seem to be a problem with it 
disconnecting if you pick it up before the third ring.  After the third ring 
it works fine.  That is all I know at this time.  Garrett Av is coming over 
today to check the system.

I know you don't like emails but I didn't want this it slip by.  I've 
discussed this with Ron and John as well.

Keith



Ken will be there.

Subject: Board Metting Dates



Mike has suggested that we cut back  board meetings to fewer than the eight 
(8) we currently hold.? In order to  give you some background, Linda checked 
other peer companies and the meetings  range from 6 to 8 a year.? 
?
I think that we can cut back to 6,  however it may be more prudent to drop to 
7 this year and first see how it goes  .? The two meetings that can be 
dropped most easily are June or  September.? 
?
June,  because we have the two day strat  plan meeting in July, and Sept. 
because we don't yet have 4th quarter results  and not a lot of new 
information is available.
?
I think that the board meetings take up   an incredible amount of Compaq 
executive time and energy. I would rather have  them concentrate on getting 6 
or 7 meetings right, getting the company back on  track and? increasing 
earnings.? So, my vote is to?recommend to the board that we  eliminate the 
September '01 meeting.? That is a particularly busy month for  many people as 
exhibited by the lack of attendance we had at this past September  meeting (5 
members).? In looking back, we seem to be able to "fill the  house" in June.
?
On the other hand, you all may want to  continue with the number of meetings 
we currently have.? I will await your  reply.
?
Regards,
?

Subject: Cougars @ Enron

Ken,
Thank you for the opportunity to meet today at the "Enron Teaching Excellence 
Awards."  It was an indeed an honor and a privilege to finally speak to you 
in person.  Ironically, when I returned to the office today I received your 
interoffice mail concerning the below email.  I certainly understand that you 
will not be able to attend many events as I am sure that your schedule is 
quite demanding.  I believe that this group will benefit substantially by 
knowing that you are aware that it exists and want to support it.  Is it 
possible to send a brief email to UH alumni at Enron letting them know as 
such?  If the alumni see that you support our efforts, they will take an 
increased interest in participating and provide us a solid foundation with 
which to work.  Please provide me any feedback you may have.

As we talked about today, we would like to begin having occasional "brown 
bags" in an effort to get the alumni better acquainted with the university.  
I believe that we should have one with Dr. Smith to promote the image 
campaign, changes at the university, the tier 1 status, etc.  If you could 
make it that would be great but if not that is OK as well.  I will send you 
the date when I have it.

Chet Gladchuk has agreed to work with us to orchestrate a tailgate party on 
Sept. 16th to welcome Dana Dimel in his first home football game.  We will 
have a tent, food, refreshments, football tickets, etc.  I suspect that it 
will be from approx. 4:00 PM to 10:00 PM.  Please let me know if your 
calendar is free.

I am truly excited to have you as alumni and am grateful for your 
approachability.  Please let me stress that I do not expect you to make all 
or even most of our events.  I would just like to let you know what we are 
doing and if you find that you are free, we would love to have you.

Thank you for your time,
Jeff

To: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON
cc:  
Subject: Cougars @ Enron

Mr. Lay,
My name is Jeff McClellan and I am President of the "Cougars @ Enron".  We 
are a group of Enron employees that are UH alumni that have banded together 
to form a chartered extension of the Houston Alumni Organization.  We had our 
kickoff event in the 50th floor dining room on March 7th of this year and 
have received substantial interest in our organization.  I wanted to drop you 
a line to tell you not only about us, but also what we are doing.  As of 
today, we have 107 employees that have expressed interest in contributing to 
our group's success. We have several stated objectives:

1. Network Enron Cougars together to build strong working relationships.  
This will benefit the employees as well as the company.
2. Raise and present scholarships to Enron dependents to attend the 
University of Houston.  This will help to ease education costs.
3. Assist the company in its recruiting efforts concerning the university.
4. Assist the university through financial gifts whenever possible.

Currently, here is what we have planned:

4/15/2000 The HAO has given us their hall at "Frontier Fiesta".   Frontier 
Fiesta is a festival thrown by the students and alumni that provides good 
family   fun. The HAO is having it catered and everyone is invited.

9/16/2000 We are throwing a tailgate party to celebrate Dana Dimel's first 
home football game against Army.  We are working with Chet Gladchuk to set up 
a   tent, have it catered, listen to a live band, football tickets, etc.  We 
would like to make this event open to all of Enron if possible.  The 
university will   provide Enron special recognition on both the Cougar Vision 
Scoreboard and over the PA in both the first and second half of the contest.

These are the confirmed events so far as we are still in the opening stages.  
We anticipate to have more events planned (golf tournament) which I would 
like the opportunity to share with you.  This group is designed to cater to 
its members, the company, and the university and I believe it is going to be 
one of the most successful out there.  To achieve such a plateau, however, we 
need to be a continuous draw to old and new alumni alike.  To have you as an 
alumni is truly a monumental draw to our employees and the university.  Would 
you consider making several appearances with us at our events?  Your 
participation would greatly increase our exposure and ability to accomplish 
our goals and we would love the chance to honor you as one of our most 
distinguished alumni.  If there are any suggestions that you may have as to 
how to further our group, I would love to hear them.  I understand that you 
are extremely busy and I do not wish to monopolize your time but this alumni 
charter is something that I truly believe in and I hope you will agree that 
it has great potential.  With you support, we can attain a level of success 
that will set us aside from any other group.

Thank you for your time,
Jeff

I can start composing a master list. He is doing the same with his parents. I

Hi Liz -

I had a very interesting conversation with Rocky.  He is still in business, 
just finishing up boots for the new President.    Also, I have been called 
"Precious" and "Baby" this morning.  Somehow, it just seems appropriate from 
him!!

He is located at RJ's Boot Company and Shoe Shop
3321 Ella Blvd. & 34th Street
Houston, Texas  77018

Subject: Invitation to ISB Dinner on May 16, 2000 in New York



Dear Governing Board member,

This is just let you know that three of our Board members - Victor Menezes
(Citibank), PC Chatterjee (The Chatterjee Group), and Uday Khemka (the SUN
Group of Industries) - are co-hosting a fund-raising dinner for the ISB on
Tuesday, May 16, 2000 in New York. While I understand this is short notice,
in case you are in New York on that date and also available for dinner, we
will be delighted if you could join us. Rajat, Dean Jacobs, and a number of
other Board members and supporters will also be there.

Please block off the date on your calendar and let me know if it is
possible for you to attend. We will be sending out a formal invitation in a
few days. Also, do let us know if you have any suggestions on who we should
invite for the event.

Please also note that the next meeting of the ISB Governing Board will be
held in New York on Thursday, September 28 from about noon to 6PM.

With best regards,

Pramath Sinha



This is a reminder of your ongoing obligation to report to the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") transactions in Lilly stock.  In light of
the complexity of the reporting rules and the potential for severe
penalties for noncompliance, please contact me in advance of any
transaction.  As a reminder, the SEC rules cover all transactions,
including:

-   purchases
-   sales
-   gifts
-   trust or partnership transactions
-   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
-   exchange fund transactions

We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two
reasons:

   There are certain times when you should not engage in market
   transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these "black-outs" occur around
   the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
   announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of "inside
   information" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our
   reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.
   While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to
   you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have
   legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.

2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.

If you had any Lilly stock transactions in November, please advise me as
soon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature
and file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").  The
reports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day
of the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am
not available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any
proposed transaction.

If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate
to call me.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Alecia A. DeCoudreaux

"Gary Hamel's 'revolutionary entrepreneurship' model represents a
substantial advance in our understanding of what companies must do to
become outstanding innovators.  It should influence not only top management

Dear Friends, Family and Wedding Party,
I am attaching a tentative itinerary for the wedding
weekend. Some of the times for transportation and hair
appointments may change as we finalize the schedules,
but for the most part, this should help you plan your
weekend.
We do not have a golf outing planned but I am assured
the Four Seasons and Hilton can help arrange golf
groups for wedding guests.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any
questions!
All our love,

Hi Mr. Lewis -

Ken asked me to send you an e-mail stating that he would be happy to submit 
your name for consideration to Dick Cheney.  He asked if you would please 
send him a current bio.  

Thanks.

Subject: New Administration


Ken,

Sorry to miss you today when I called. Since I am leaving for India in a
few minutes, I thought I would sent you an E-mail, and then I can try to
call you from India. Because of the time difference, it will not be easy
for us to connect. Unfortunately I will not be back in the US until
December 7.

The reason for my call was to see if you would feel comfortable putting my
name forward to Dick Cheney for a position in the new administration. I am
not sure where the best fit would be, but it might be Chairman of the
National Economic Council. That job has a good combination of management
and economics. You know I have only been associated with Democratic
administrations in past, but Democratic administrations were a little
different in those days. You are somewhat familiar with my record on
economics and there is a lot on that in the public domain.

Just let me know what you think. Maybe a quick E-mail would suffice ( I am
carrying my computer).

Best regards,
Bill

Hi Mr. Ramsay -

In regard to your request for Ken to chair a Forum segment and join the 
Ministerial dinner, with the Chair of the other Session in May, he said that 
he would be delighted to participate.

We look forward to receiving additional information after the Governing Board

Hi Mr. Moore -

I'm sorry that we didn't discuss dates this morning as Mr. Lay is on vacation 
until September 5.  As that will be his first week back after being out for 
several weeks, it is already pretty booked up. 

I will certainly share this e-mail with him.  Is it possible to update Mr. 
Lay on the progress of the Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy by 
e-mail?  Another thought might be to see if our Executive Vice President of 
Human Resources, Cindy Olson,  would be available to meet with you on August 
28 or 29.  Ms. Olson is in charge of Enron's Community Relations Department.

Please advise.

Rosalee

Subject: Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy



I would like to schedule a short meeting in your office to  share the 
remarkable progress that the Committee to Encourage Corporate  Philanthropy 
is making and to ask that you consider hosting a meeting for  ten to fifteen 
CEOs of other major Houston corporations to encourage their  participation in 
the only forum of CEOs focused on the agenda of corporate  giving.
?
I'm anxious to meet you as we have so many friends in  common: three of your 
directors, John Duncan, Pug Winokur and Norm Blake, and  the Slocums, to name 
just a few.
?
I look forward to hearing from you.
?
?
P.S. If it works in your schedule, I'm available to come  to Houston on 
August 28 or 29 or anytime the week of September  4.


Mr. Lay responded that he is unable to attend.  I know that you already have 
that message as someone has called, but I wanted to let you know also.

Hello Mr. Lay,

It's been a long time since we've talked.  I'm Priscilla Slade, President of
Texas Southern University.  The primary purpose of this e-mail is to invite
you to attend a weekend at the home of President and Mrs. Bush September
16-18.  So many people have expressed a desire to become know more about the
University (it's new initiatives and successes) that  President Bush
volunteered to host a gathering of 25 CEOs and spouses (or a second person
in the corporate hierarchy).  In addition to having fun golfing, sailing,
boating, etc., we are presenting ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT TEXAS SOUTHERN
UNIVERSITY.

I know this is your favorite topic and that we can look forward to you
joining us.  An invitation is in the mail.  I look forward to you joining
us.

Sincerely,

Priscilla



Diane, I will definitely show this to Ken, but he has a Dain Rauscher 
presentation near the Galleria at 8:00 a.m. that morning, so I know he can't 
attend.

Subject: Alzheimer's Research Update

On September 19th Dr. Bill Thies, vice president of medical and scientific 
affairs for the national Alzheimer's Association, will be in Houston to  
provide an update on some of the new and successful research underway for 
Alzheimer's disease.  He'll also be meeting with local reseachers to learn 
what they're doing in order to support and potentially fund their work.  
Since all of you have been such great supporters of our efforts to raise 
funds for this very cause, Phil and I are hosting a breakfast so you can hear 
firsthand how your money is being spent.  No pledge cards will be handed out 
at the door--just juice, coffee and maybe a bagel.  Please join us to hear an 
update from Dr. Thies on September  19 from 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. in the Enron 
Building, Room 49C1.  Please RSVP to Adriana Wynn at X55176.



 


Hi Mr. Moore -

I did hear back from Mr. Lay.  Will September 11 at 3:00 p.m. work for you?

I look forward to hearing from you.

With regard to working out a convenient date to meet with  you, Rosalee has 
suggested that your week of September 4 is pretty well  booked-up. Would 
either September 11 or 13 work? After that I have to join Norm  Blake at the 
Olympics in Sydney. While all of this can de done by phone, as  deputy to the 
chairmen, I'm making every effort to meet (albeit briefly) with  each 
Committee member. If you are willing to host a meeting in Houston, I want  to 
make every effort to have Paul Newman in  attendance.


Amy, you are a treasure!!!  I know you'll be a treasure of a Mom, too!!  But 
I'll miss you!!

Hi!

Just a quick note to say good-bye and thank you after five and a half years!  
My last day at Enron will be Thursday, August 31st.  I will be heading off to 
two new jobs -- to be a full-time mom once Baby Lee arrives and to start my 
own stationary/invitations company.  

I have thoroughly enjoyed working with all of you.  Thank you for all the 
opportunities you have given me over the years.   For your Community 
Relations needs, Elyse Kalmans is heading up the department.  She can be 
reached at 713.853.0565.

Thanks!

I seem to have three appointments next week:

Tuesday, August 29:  Doctor appointment at 9:40 a.m. (enlightenment)

Wednesday, August 30:  Hair appointment @ 2:00 p.m (beauty)

Thursday, August 31:  Dental appointment @ 2:00 p.m. (ouch)


I plan to return to the office each day, but the dental appointment may take 
awhile.

Dear Dean Walker -

Ken Lay asked me to respond to you re:  1). naming the new professorship the 
Pinkney C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship - this is fine.
2)  He will be pleased to serve as the keynote speaker for the banquet on 
October 13.

Thanks.

Rosalee

Subject: P. Walker professorship and keynote request


Thanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the
professorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted that you plan to
attend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.

The purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient
way of reaching you, is two-fold:

     1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney
C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the
professorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some
other area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in
the College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.
Both Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into
Harold Hook to seek his input.

A few points of elaboration:
     * "Distinguished" is a standard adjective in the titles of such
positions.
     * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the
college to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my
approval.
     * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October
13.

This name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength,
(2) allows me to avoid any "turf battles" (either within the college or with
Economics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the
college.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.

     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society
banquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief
talk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of
business.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive
event.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now
live in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have
chosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.
Your talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed
(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.
I understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the
morning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable
for the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in
choosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you
will serve as the keynote speaker.

If you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the
plans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney
Walker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if
you have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is
573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.

Let me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not
Pinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been
experiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that
he intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.
Time permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll
see him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his
wife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I
will host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.  Of
course, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it's
my understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)

Ken, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of "R&R"
during your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.


Dar, are you on-line?  If so, please answer back.  I have questions.  Well, 
I'll ask them.  Did you get the wedding pics?

Mr. Hines -

To get back with you re: your question about some kind of Futures/Options 
market in the commercial space market, Ken Lay said that to approach Jeff 
Skilling about it is absolutely the right approach.

Subject: Arena


I wanted to make sure you were aware of something that has come up since
the last breakfast meeting regarding our group financing the Arena parking
garage.  Baker & Botts put us in touch with the Rockets to discuss Hines
being the Development Manager on the Arena and garage.  Although not fully
agreed, there is strong interest on both sides.  Besides help on the
development front, we think there may be value in our acting as a bit of a
buffer between the Sports Authority and the Rockets and coordinating any
issues involving the new convention hotel(where we are also providing
development management).  The Rockets(Mike Goldberg-Baker & Botts) have
talked to Ric Campo and supposedly he is enthusiastic but thinks this
should "be the Authority's idea.".  One issue is how much of our fee would
apply to the garage, which presumably the city would pick up, and how much
would apply to the Arena.  Since this is a fast moving issue, I wanted you
to know about this. Obviously the discussions are all very confidential.
If you have any thoughts in advance of the next breakfast meeting, please
give me a call at 713-966-2606.

Also, on another topic, we have been doing a tiny bit of pie in the sky
brainstorming on the concept of creating some kind of Futures/Options
market in the commercial space market.  I will approach Jeff Skilling
unless you would recommend elsewhere within Enron.

Good morning Ken,
Just wanted to take a moment to thank you for being the "Honorary Chair" for 
the Cougars@Enron golf tournament to be held on March 21, 2001.  I enjoyed 
meeting you at the "Enron Excellence Awards" presentation and genuinely 
appreciate your support.  When we spoke, you said that you may not be able to 
play in the tournament.  I certainly understand, but if you are available to 
play (or make an appearance at the dinner afterward), it would most 
beneficial to our outcome.  Please let me know if you are available.

Thanks,

on product sales.  In exchange, Lilly will receive exclusive worldwide

rights to products resulting from the collaboration.  Lilly will be

responsible for conducting clinical trials, securing regulatory approvals

and marketing on a worldwide basis.  Clinical trials of the first product

candidate are under way in North America and Europe.  Lilly will also have

the option to develop a number of additional products depending on the

success of the initial product.



"We look forward to working with Generex, whose buccal spray delivery

technology potentially represents a novel approach to drug delivery," said

James A. Harper, president, diabetes and growth disorders products for

Lilly. "A buccal spray formulation of insulin could provide an attractive

alternative for people with diabetes."



"The opportunity to partner with Lilly, the global leader in insulins, to

develop the world's first marketed buccal insulin spray represents very

good news for millions of patients with diabetes throughout the world,"

said Anna Gluskin, chief executive officer of Generex. "We are pleased that

Lilly has recognized the potential of buccal delivery of insulin and

Generex's RapidMist? technology for systemic delivery of proteins, peptides

and other large molecule drugs."



Today, worldwide costs for treating diabetes and its complications are

estimated to exceed $200 billion annually.  It is also estimated that, over

the next decade, the number of people with this disease will more than

double.  Lilly has been a leader in diabetes care for more than 75 years.

The company continues to aggressively pursue the goal of being a complete

diabetes care company and intends to provide innovative products to treat

all types and stages of diabetes.



Generex is engaged in the research and development of drug delivery systems

and technologies. To date, it has focused on developing a platform

technology for the buccal delivery (absorption through the inner cheek

walls) of large molecule drugs which, historically, have been administered

only by injection. Additional information about Generex can be found at

www.generex.com.



Lilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing

portfolio of best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest

research from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with

eminent scientific organizations. Headquartered in Indianapolis, Ind.,

Lilly provides answers ? through medicines and information ? for some of

the world's most urgent medical needs.

Cynthia, Ken said to tell you that he told David Sokol we would probably 
oppose it.

Subject: New PUHCA Exemption Legislative Language

Yesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the 
attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for 
companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by 
independent market analysts (i.e. "A" rating for Holding Companies or 
investment grade rating for utility companies).  This is not a permanent 
exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.

MidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's 
reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, 
Ken Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.

The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an 
amendment to a "must pass" piece of legislation during the waning days of 
this Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' 
strategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes 
tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as 
contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to 
paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth 
Edison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. 
2944).

Senator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA 
amendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed 
to the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've 
reviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the 
concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was 
Senator Kerrey's idea.  

It is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) 
would still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact 
that Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the 
Democrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not 
he is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive 
electricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is "at least 
three years away from happening."

Steve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position 
on this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to 
oppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like 
Southern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the 
MidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access 
provisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support. 





Ms. Peppers, I am very sorry, but I must once again reschedule the 
appointment that you have with Mr. Lay.  He will be out of town the entire 
week of September 26.  

The first available time to reschedule is October 19, 2000.  Would an 
afternoon appointment work for you - about 2:00 p.m.?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Rosalee
OOps, I can't seem to open it!!

Dr. Lay:

We need a bio of you to include in the program for the Herbert J. Davenport
program on October 13. I have attached the bio of you that we used in the
brochure announcing the Pinkney C. Walker Endowment. Perhaps, with a few
adjustments, it will be suitable for this current need.

Please review the bio and send me any changes you would like made as soon as
possible.

Thank you very much for your prompt attention to this.

             Eli Lilly and Company Launches Lillydiabetes.com
          New Web Site Designed To Help Patients Manage Diabetes

 Lillydiabetes.com is valuable resource for the 16 million Americans with
                                 diabetes


Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) has launched lillydiabetes.com (

http://www.lillydiabetes.com), an interactive Web site designed to help the

16 million Americans with diabetes and their families understand and manage

the disease and its complications.  The Web site provides patients

information about diabetes and gives them tools to help manage their

disease.



"Diabetes is a progressive, potentially debilitating disease that requires

regular monitoring of blood sugar, blood pressure and weight, among other

things," said Doug Rude, e-commerce team leader, Eli Lilly and Company.

"Lillydiabetes.com can help empower patients and their families with the

information and tools necessary to manage their disease and live healthier

lives."



Lillydiabetes.com has a number of features and tools to encourage

aggressive management of diabetes.  Because diabetes is a chronic,

progressive disease, it is important that patients closely track their

progress toward better blood-sugar control, as well as the development of

diabetes-related complications. Those who register with the site have

access

to customizable "Measures of Control" tools designed to help patients

monitor their diabetes and the complications that can arise.  The Measures

of Control tools include:



?    HbA1c Chart (blood-sugar control) ? Hemoglobin A1c test measures
average blood-sugar levels over a two to three-month period.  Each time an
HbA1c test is done, patients can enter the value and save it as a color
graph, which then can be used to track the patient's progress toward better
blood-sugar control.
?    Height and Weight Index ? Excess body fat can lead to insulin
resistance, a major factor in the development of type 2 diabetes.  This
tool helps patients calculate their body mass index, which is a measure of
body weight relative to height.  The Web site then provides a place to save
that information and chart progress toward desired weight.


?    Blood Pressure Chart ? A common complication of diabetes is high blood
pressure, which can lead to heart disease as well as signal other
potentially serious problems, such as diabetic kidney disease.  This tool
allows patients to enter their blood pressure levels, save them and chart
their progress.


Other resources found on lillydiabetes.com include:



Product Information ? With more than 75 years of innovation in diabetes

care, Eli Lilly and Company has developed many products for the treatment

of diabetes.  This section informs users about treatment options and the

latest breakthroughs.



Lilly Diabetes Today?  Newsletter ? Users can request to receive by e-mail

this newsletter, which provides information about the latest diabetes

developments and research, as well as recipe ideas and inspiring articles.



Patient Check List ? This section provides patients and family members with

a list of issues that should be addressed by their doctor, enabling them to

work with their physician to aggressively manage their disease.



Educational Resources ? Lillydiabetes.com provides information on an array

of diabetes-related topics.  Subject headings include:  About Diabetes,

Diabetes Management, Planning Meals, Diabetes Resources, and Diabetes

Products.



Lilly plans to add new tools and features to the site every 90 days.  The

new features will help equip patients, physicians and other health care

professionals with online tools that improve understanding of the disease

and delivery of care to patients.

Lilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing

portfolio of best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest

 Study Shows Efficacy of Zyprexa Superior to Valproate in the Treatment of
               Acute Mania Associated with Bipolar Disorder
          Study is the largest comparison of two mood stabilizers


Zyprexac (olanzapine, Lilly) provides better control of manic symptoms

during treatment of acute manic or mixed manic episodes compared with

valproate (Depakotec, Abbott), according to new data presented today at the

13th European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Congress (ECNP) in Munich.

The study is the first head-to-head comparison of Zyprexa and valproate

since the FDA's approval of the use of Zyprexa for bipolar mania in March.



Key Findings

Dosing was based on both drugs' package inserts (see Study Design for more

information). The study's primary efficacy measure was the Young-Mania

Rating Scale (Y-MRS), an 11-item scale used to assess the severity of a

patient's mania. Key study endpoint findings included:



?    The Zyprexa group experienced a significantly greater improvement on
the Y-MRS total score than did patients treated with valproate (49% vs.
38%).
?    A greater proportion of Zyprexa patients achieved remission from manic
symptoms (defined as Y-MRS Total Score < 12) compared with valproate
patients (47% vs. 34%).
?    54% of patients on Zyprexa experienced a 50% or more improvement in
Y?MRS scores compared with 42% of the valproate patients.
?    Zyprexa patients demonstrated a statistically significant improvement
in certain Y-MRS Individual Item Scores compared with valproate patients:
activity/energy (53% vs. 41%), sleep (69% vs. 45%) and language-thought
disorder (49% vs. 35%).  Changes in other core symptoms of mania as defined
by the Y-MRS Individual Item Scores were similar for the two treatment
groups.




Study Design

The three-week, randomized, parallel, double-blind, acute-phase study

examined 251 hospitalized patients at 44 sites who met the DSM-IV criteria

for a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and were experiencing acute manic or

mixed episodes. Subjects received olanzapine in a flexible dose range of 5

to 20 mg/day (once daily) or valproate in a flexible does range of 500 to

2,500  mg/day (multiple doses per day). The mean ending dose for Zyprexa

was 17 mg/day and the mean ending dose for valproate was 1500 mg/day. In

addition, plasma levels were monitored to ensure valproate trough levels

were maintained within the targeted therapeutic range of 50-125 ?g/mL; the

mean value of all levels obtained was 79.4 ?g/mL. Clinicians determined

dosing based on each patient's clinical response as well as the blood

levels in patients taking valproate. Lorazepam use was restricted to a

maximum dose of 2 mg/day, and administration was prohibited within eight

hours of a psychiatric exam.



Additional Study Results

Neither Zyprexa nor valproate induced depressive symptoms in bipolar manic

or mixed patients.  In fact, both Zyprexa and valproate patients showed an

improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression

Rating Scale (HAMD-21).  However, Zyprexa patients showed greater

improvement at the study endpoint in HAMD-21 scores (35% vs. 24%).  The

effects of Zyprexa have not yet been studied in bipolar depression.



Zyprexa was generally well tolerated. The most common and significantly

different adverse events for Zyprexa were somnolence (39.2% vs. 20.6% for

valproate), dry mouth (33.6% vs. 6.3%), and increased appetite (12.0% vs.

2.4%).  The most common adverse event for valproate was nausea (28.6% vs.

10.4% for Zyprexa). Additional safety information for Zyprexa and valproate

can be obtained from their package inserts.



"These data support the value of Zyprexa as a much needed treatment

option," said Mauricio Tohen, M.D., Dr. P.H., medical adviser, Lilly

Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, and lead investigator for the

study.  "The findings provide further evidence that Zyprexa effectively

stabilizes mood in patients with bipolar disorder."



Manic symptoms occur during the manic phase of bipolar disorder, a lifelong

illness characterized by disruptive swings in mood.  Symptoms include

abnormal elation and/or irritability, often accompanied by an unrealistic

belief in one's own abilities, increased sex drive, delusions and alcohol

or drug abuse.  People with bipolar disorder also may experience mixed

episodes, marked by symptoms of mania and clinical depression occurring

simultaneously. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,

Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).  American Psychiatric Association, 1994.


Zyprexa (olanzapine, Lilly)
valproate (Depakote, Abbott)


The study findings are particularly pertinent in light of valproate's

recent revised black box warning from the Food and Drug Administration

following reports of life-threatening pancreatitis in both children and

adults.



"Physicians have good reason to take these new data into account," said

Carlos A. Zarate, M.D., associate professor of psychiatry and director,

bipolar and psychotic disorders program, University of Massachusetts

Medical Center.  "The efficacy of Zyprexa coupled with its favorable safety

profile suggest that it may provide a timely treatment alternative for

patients with bipolar disorder."



Zyprexa is indicated in the United States for the management of the

manifestations of psychotic disorders as demonstrated in short-term

clinical trials with schizophrenia patients.  It is also approved for the

short-term treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar

disorder.



In the original schizophrenia registration trials, olanzapine was generally

well tolerated.  However, as with all medications, olanzapine was

associated with some side effects.  In the original six-week, acute-phase

schizophrenia trials, the most common treatment-emergent adverse event

associated with olanzapine was somnolence.  Other common events were

dizziness, weight gain, constipation, akathisia (restlessness), and

postural hypotension.  Modest elevations of prolactin were also seen,

although mean changes from baseline to endpoint were not statistically

significantly different between olanzapine and placebo.  A small number of

patients experienced asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminase; none

of these patients developed jaundice or drug-induced hepatitis.



In short-term (three- and four-week) acute bipolar mania trials, the most

common treatment-emergent adverse event associated with olanzapine was

somnolence.  Other common events were dry mouth, dizziness, asthenia,

constipation, dyspepsia, increased appetite, and tremor.

have changed their schedules to make this meeting because of the chance to
talk to Arthur, I regret the inconvenience.

 In deference to your time, we'll go ahead with the meeting from 5 to
7 but not with the dinner.

 Here are the details of the meeting.  Note that the location is
different from the previous two meetings.

     1.  Do you agree with the substance
of this draft?
     2.  Are there points that should
receive more or less emphasis?
     3.  Are there any other issues you
would like to raise?
     4.  Is there anything else about the
drafting and presentation that you would
like to comment on?

 We will need to get everyone's comments, one way or another, by the
end of September so we can proceed to prepare the final paper, which we'd
like to have ready by the end of October.

Several, months ago Limas Jefferson wrote you a letter requesting your 
support for business opportunities at Enron.  That letter was subsequently 
forwarded to Cindy Olson and me.  As you can see from the note below, we were 
able to arrange for Jefferson & Associations to partner with Compaq on the 
Windows 2000 Project.  You commented on Mr Jefferson's letter that you would 
consider meeting with him.  I can be of assistance in coordinating a meeting 
between the two of you.   Please advise.

FYI - Mr. Jefferson had a difficult time reaching me because my phone number 
changed when my office moved to 3AC.

Calvin,

I just wish to report that starting tomorrow JEFFERSON will supply the third
person to Compaq in support of the Enron Windows 2000 project.  I called you
almost everyday when we were not getting a response, so it is only fair that
you also share in the good news.  Also, thank you for all your support in
making this occasion possible.

You are a good man!

Please stay in touch.

Good morning, Joe.  Ken is on a cruise, so is not available, but I did talk

Apparently, everything is still internal.  He said everything is fine, so 
hopefully, you don't need to be concerned.

Talk to you soon.

Subject: Selection Of My Successor-My Concern

Ken: I have "heard" from two sources in this office that Enron will announce 
my successor today. I have not been advised of the selection and am concerned 
that this announcement will not treat my retirement in an appropriate and 
deserving manner.

I have placed calls to Steve Kean since hearing this rumor but have not 
received a response as of now. Admittedl, our phone service because of the 
office construction is not totally functioning.

Frankly, I think this matter has not been handled in a caring way and I have 
been acccused of giving information on the selection to Tom DeLay which is 
untrue. My office mates are all more aware of the candidates and their status 
than I have been.

I regret having to contact you on this matter but feel that despite my total 
cooperation, allegiance and dedication to Enron, I am not being treated with 
the courtesy and sensitivity that this matter deserves.

Joe

Good morning, Michael.  Will there be enough funds to help Sue without

Subject: Referendum Campaign


Mr. Lay--

I have been assisting John Watson with his representation of Sports
Facilities, L.P., and I am in the process of coordinating the $1.4 million
prepayment by the Sports Authority and the contribution of such amount by
the partners to the referendum campaign.

Assuming that we receive the prepayment from the Sports Authority, we expect
to be able to start making contributions to the referendum campaign this
week.  The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign by the
partnership, on behalf of each partner, upon receipt of instructions from
each such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributed
to the campaign instead of being distributed.  I have discussed this
procedure with Sue Walden.

With respect to your arrangement with Shell, we were not sure what you and
Shell had agreed to.  The monies being contributed to the referendum
campaign are being contributed to a special purpose political action
committee (as required by law).  This special purpose PAC is subject to the
general Texas laws that govern campaign fundraising.  As you know, one of
these laws provides that "a person may not knowingly make or authorize a
political contribution in the name of or on behalf of another unless the
person discloses in writing to the recipient the name and address of the
person actually making the contribution . . . ."   Pending a better
understanding of the Shell arrangement, we will hold Shell's $100,000 in the
partnership's account.

Please contact John Watson at 713-758-2556 or me at 713-758-2350 if you have
any questions regarding the foregoing.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Telle

Dear Dad and Mark,
I am attaching the resume of the lovely and talented
Ms. Amanda Day who, like all wise soon to be graduates
of businees school, is very interested in a position
at Enron.
Of course she would be an incredibly valuable addition
to the Enron team and to Houston. If you have any
questions about her character, achievements, or goals,
please feel free to contact me.
All my love,
Elizabeth

Ken, as a reminder, can we set up a meeting with the young American Indian 
man that I met and spoke with at the Holocaust Museum Houston - The Human 
Race Open House on 8/5/99?

If so, let's do it over lunch as I know he has a 15 min. video to show us.  
Also, I'd like to include Cindy and whomever else you wish.

     RPI TO INITIATE PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS ON ANTI-HEPATITIS C DRUG

BOULDER,  Colorado  -  September  28,  2000: Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(RPI)  (NASDAQ:RZYM)  today announced that it has repurchased its rights to
Heptazyme?  from  Eli Lilly and Company and will initiate Phase II clinical
trials  as  soon  as  possible  for  the Anti-Hepatitis C ribozyme to study
dose-ranging  and  biological  markers  of  the  drug's efficacy in chronic
Hepatitis C patients.

Earlier  this month, RPI and Eli Lilly and Company completed a 28 day study
of Heptazyme (LY466700) following daily subcutaneous injections that showed
successful  safety,  tolerability  and pharmacokinetics.  The next phase of
clinical trials will examine the safety and efficacy of Heptazyme alone, at
higher  doses  than  used  in  previous  studies,  and  in combination with
interferon,  a  current  treatment  for  patients  with  Hepatitis C  virus
infection.

Lilly has directed the clinical trials for the Anti-Hepatitis C ribozyme to
date   under   a   licensing   agreement  between  the  parties.   Ribozyme
Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.  has now renegotiated the global rights to Heptazyme
and  will  direct  all  subsequent  clinical trials.  The Phase II trial is
expected to begin in the first quarter of 2001.

"We  are  pleased  to  be  able  to repurchase Heptazyme rights and to have
resources  to  develop  it aggressively," said Ralph E. Christoffersen, CEO
and  President  of RPI.  "We are committed to address the need for improved
therapies  for  HCV,  and  plan  to  move forward as quickly as feasible in
Heptazyme's development."

Ribozymes   are  the  product  of  Nobel  Prize  winning  science  and  are
synthetically engineered to act as "molecular scissors" capable of cleaving
target RNA in a highly specific manner.

RPI (www.rpi.com), located in Boulder, Colorado, is the acknowledged leader
in ribozyme therapeutic development.  RPI has recently announced a ribozyme
commercial  development  program  to develop a ribozyme therapeutic against
Hepatitis  B.  RPI is partnered with Chiron Corporation for the development
and  commercialization  of ANGIOZYME?, an anti-angiogenic ribozyme designed
to  inhibit  the  growth  of new blood supplies to tumors and prevent tumor
growth  and  metastasis.   ANGIOZYME  is  in  Phase I/II clinical trials in
cancer  patients  at  the  Cleveland Clinic.  RPI is also partnered with an
affiliate  of Elan Corporation plc for development and commercialization of
HERZYME?, an anti-HER-2 ribozyme for treatment of breast and other cancers,
through RPI's subsidiary Medizyme Pharmaceuticals Ltd.

RPI  will  have  a Live Webcast regarding this information today at 3:00 pm
MDT.  This webcast can be accessed through the RPI website (www.rpi.com) in
the Investor Relations section.


This  press  release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks
and  uncertainties,  and  actual  events  or results may differ materially.
These   risk   factors   include   actions   by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug
Administration,   technological  advances,  ability  to  obtain  rights  to
technology, ability to obtain and enforce patents, ability to commercialize
and  manufacture  products  and  general  economic  conditions.  These  and
additional  risk  factors  are  identified  in  RPI Securities and Exchange
Commission  filings,  including  the  Forms  10-K and 10-Q and in other SEC
filings.



Hi Michael -

Mr. Lay--

During the negotiations with the Rockets as to how much each party would
contribute to the Arena referendum campaign, Mike Goldberg of Baker & Botts
suggested that the Rockets would like to net their contribution obligation
against other contributions that they solicited.

After a conversation with you, John Watson and I advised Mike Goldberg that
you did not want to be competing with the Rockets in soliciting
contributions to the Arena referendum campaign.

Mike Goldberg called Friday and asked whether it would be acceptable for the
Rockets to net against their contribution obligation contributions that they
have solicited from Baker & Botts, Jim MacInvale and Tilman Fertitta.  Mike
suggested that these three persons would be the only outside persons that
would be solicited by the Rockets.

Would you please let me know if this is acceptable to you.  You or Rosalee
may call me at 713-758-2350 or send me a response e-mail at
mtelle@velaw.com.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Telle

This is a reminder of your ongoing obligation to report to the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") transactions in Lilly stock.  In light of
the complexity of the reporting rules and the potential for severe
penalties for noncompliance, please contact me in advance of any
transaction.  As a reminder, the SEC rules cover all transactions,
including:

-   purchases
-   sales
-   gifts
-   trust or partnership transactions
-   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
-   exchange fund transactions

We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two
reasons:

   There are certain times when you should not engage in market
   transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these "black-outs" occur around
   the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
   announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of "inside
   information" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our
   reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.
   While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to
   you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have
   legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.

2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.

If you had any Lilly stock transactions in September, please advise me as
soon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature
and file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").  The
reports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day
of the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am
not available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any
proposed transaction.

If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate
to call me.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Alecia A. DeCoudreaux

I appreciate your comments regarding Enron's advertising focus.  First, Enr=

Energy Services.  Acquiring the naming rights to the stadium came much late=

in our negotiations with the Astros.  In addition, while sports events like=
=20
NASCAR are exciting to watch and get a fair amount of media play,  we're=20
targeting a more specific audience with our advertising dollars.
 =20
Increasingly, Enron=01,s integrated products and services require the appro=
val=20
of an organization=01,s highest ranking officers, people who carry a =01&CX=
O=018=20
title, such as chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief=20
information officer or chief technology officer. These individuals may not=
=20
recognize Enron=01,s name and abilities as readily as energy-centric execut=
ives.

We also want to reach the elected and appointed officials who set policy an=
d=20
regulations affecting Enron businesses worldwide. The "Ask Why" advertising=
=20
campaign launched in February this year was designed with these groups in=
=20
mind as well as to put the Enron name and image on everyone=01,s radar scre=
en.=20
Enron commercials continue to appear on business channels such as CNBC and=
=20
CNNfn, as well as the History Channel, ESPN and network news programs. Some=
=20
are running in Europe as well.

While we won't rule out entirely the possibility of directing some of our=
=20
future advertising dollars toward sports events, for now, we believe we are=
=20
spending our ad budget where it will have the greatest positive impact on o=
ur=20
business.

Thanks for your suggestion.  Keep them coming.

Mr. Lay,

I wasn't able to get my question to you at the all employee meeting. It was=

The Enron sponsored Houston mini-cart Grand Prix entry placed second and=20

Re George W. Bush Debate Win/Al Gore's Lies

I hope you got a chance to see the debate last night.  George W. Bush did a
very good job articulating his message and debating Al Gore.

I am sure it will come as no surprise to you that Al Gore could not go the
entire debate without telling a lie.  In fact, two lies have been exposed so
far.

The first one was Gore's claim that he visited Texas with FEMA Director,
James Lee Witt, after the bad Texas floods and tornadoes.  As it turns out,
that was a lie.  Al Gore on the morning news shows today claimed that he
thought he had, but it must have been another state.  Go figure.

The next lie exposed is as follows:

News radio 970 WFLA interviewed the principal of Sarasota High this morning.
He said that the girl that Gore was talking about had no desk for exactly
one day.  It was the first day of class and they were still making
adjustments to the kids class schedule and that particular classroom was
being refurbished.  The teacher only had to call the office and get her a
desk because they have plenty of desks there.  Apparently there is a picture
that was sent to Gore of her standing in class or something like that
because the Principal mentions that in the picture of her there is $100,000
of new equipment behind her.

Please pass this along to your friends and family and any undecided voters.
The more people who realize that Al Gore is a pathological liar, the better
George W. Bush will do.

Please check out the two links and cast your vote for George W. Bush as the
winner in last night's debate:  http://news.excite.com/news/poll/ or
http://www.cnn.com/

Last but not least....Have you done everything you can do to elect George W.
Bush?  Have you made a small contribution to Victory 2000?  Have you
participated in a literature drop for the GOP Ticket or made phone calls on
its behalf?  If not, please let me know.

Thanks for your support.

Mr. Chairman,
?
Archer's ex son in law is contacting him to see if  he do a spot similar to 
what the President did for us in 1996. We can cut the  spot at Archer's 
convenience and he will have total script approval,  obviously.
?
I am preparing a poll memorandum showing that this  will not kill him with 
Republicans, especially younger Republicans, so he has  nothing to fear.
?
I will also send him a copy of the President's spot  from '96.
?
I understand that Jordan is trying to contact  Archer also.
?
Anything that you could do to encourage Archer to  consider this will be of 
great help. We didn't poll on Archer...but I know his  support will have a 
tremendous impact on the Westside and we need  that.
?

Since you left for India, and in case I forget to tell you, I asked to have a 
new banking rep to replace Howard Williams for LPL Prop & Interiors.  Since I 
was doing this, both Sally and Sherrie felt it best to have all of our 
business with one person rather than dealing with two.  So, we will now be 
dealing with Margaret Barradas who is Howard's superior.  Where James Shelton 
was a hard act to follow, Howard should be a piece of cake.  Anyone merely 
pleasant and respectful would be an upgrade to Howard and hopefully our new 
rep will fill the bill.   Love, L.

Hi Liz -

The reason Ken and Linda were trying to reach you from the plane was that 
they had some suggestions for the hotel rooms and wanted you to know their 
preference.  They would like to give the Jasmine Suite that they are 
currently in to the Vittors with a connecting bedroom, to take care of their 
family.

They would like Mark and Natalie to have the end or corner suite that the 
Vittors have.

Ken and Linda said that they would prefer two connecting rooms, hopefully on 
the 3rd or 4th floor.  They would like for the rooms to have the ocean view 
on the North side.  If that isn't possible, it would be o.k. to overlook the 
pool, but they would not really like the south side as it wouldn't be as 
quiet.  The two rooms would give them everything they need, with 2 baths.

They said they can be reached in Switzerland tomorrow.  The Hotel Meierhof's 
phone number is:  41-81-416-82-85, Fax is:  41-81-416-39-82.  They should 
arrive in Davos about 9:00 a.m.

I know you will have a beautiful and wonderful wedding!!  Thank you so much 
for including me on the Save the Date list.  I feel honored!  Unfortunately, 
we won't be able to come.   Our "first" anniversary is June 3, but was 1961!!

Take care and call if we can do anything.

Rosie
Attached file is a memo from our pollster on  Republicans should you talk to 
Bill  Archer.

?

Channel 2 did a poll story on Thursday  which shows the Arena with a 19 or 20 
point lead. It was their poll. Our  latest show about the same.

?
--Dave Walden
 - Arena-Republican poll memo.doc
Russell, I think it will be Kenneth.Lay@Enron.com.  Do we capitalize all the 
words, but com?  I noticed that mine is Rosalee.Fleming@Enron.com.  I had 
sent something to my home e-mail address.  This may not be a good test as I 
am sending it from my home computer, from his mail-box, but not from his 
computer.  Oh, well, we'll see!!

Rosie
Dad,
We are not going to go to D.C. on the 16th as Jose
Luis needs to be back here for meetings on the 16th.
This just came up. He would like to meet with Lynn
Coleman at some time, but it may neet to wait until
later this month (depending on how things go this
Friday).
I hope you guys had a good time in Palm Beach. Houston
is FREEZING! Now we have perfect weather in Florida,
though with hight of only 78!
I'll see you this weekend.
Love,
Elizabeth

Well, I know this is terribly short notice, but Ken does have a meeting with 
Tom DeLay on Monday morning at 9:30 a.m.  (I know that's half a day gone for 
Joe if he's in town), but he is coming in to discuss RMIC (Republican 
Majority Issues Committee).  Are there specific things that Ken needs to be 
briefed on?  I know that Steve did recommend that Ken have this meeting.

Thanks very much.

Rosie

Hi Corey -

My champion, hero, angel - I think I have made a major mistake!!!  I thought 
I had tickets to Mark McGuire's team for May 12, but it is the Cinncinatti 
Reds!!!  I am so sorry.  Is that going to be o.k.?  That's  what I get for 
thinking I know anything about baseball.

Look forward to hearing from you!!

Love,

Aunt Rosie
The Chronicle is developing a front page story  based on a Garnett Coleman 
idea to change state law to allow Sports Authority  tax funds to go to fund 
public hospitals.
?
It is my judgement that this story and the spin  afterwards could easily 
shave 10 points off our yes #'s and make this a  horserace again.
?
It is even worse than the stealth tax increase in  '96 because it cuts to the 
heart of voters' objections to the funding of sports  facilities. And it 
takes away our reponse that this money cannot legally ever be  used to fund 
hospitals or education. This was the basis of their successful  attack in 
'99---only this time we don't have any real response.
?
The Chronicle has delayed this story for  one day.
?
I won't waste your time reviewing the various  things we have done to spin 
this better. We have done many things. But it is  like putting bandaids on a 
gaping chest wound.
?
Could you call Jack Loftis or Sweeney at  the Chronicle? We need to downplay 
it or kill it. I have more info if you want to  talk---713-851-2576.

There will be news on this subject soon that could  make the Rockets payments 
to the city look very paltry without some good spin.  Since you did the Enron 
Deal, I wanted to give you a heads up and some talking  points which I will 
have for you Monday. I think the news will keep until  then.
Hi Mr. Garten and Valerie -

We have been working on Ken's schedule.  It is a fairly busy week, but it 
looks like he could do a 30 minute conference call on Wed. at 2:30 p.m. (New 
York time), if that is still good for you.  Please let me know if Wednesday 
is a satisfactory time for the phone call.  That appears to be the only 
window he has next week.

Valerie had already sent the SEC Panel Outline on 4/11, which you attached 
below.  Ken Lay has already seen it.

Re:  the other question that you asked about Ken Lay's name appearing in a 
press release, he said that is fine.

Dear Ken,

We are in the process of trying to arrange a conference call with you on
either Tuesday or Wednesday of next week to discuss the paper which is
attached.  ( I'm sending it along now so that you have some time to look at
it.)

We will be doing this by conference call and once we set a time to talk with
you, will give you the number to call.  (To set up a time, your office can
contact my assistant, Valerie Petersen either at valerie.petersen@yale.edu
or at 203-432-6035.)

Look forward to speaking with you next week.

Best regards,

Subject: Phone Call










Hey there,

I just called your dad and congratulated the "father of the bride"  He was 
VERY cute and walked me through his conversation with JL and his thoughts on 
Florida...FUN FUN FUN - He is so proud of you and thinks so highly of JL - I 
can hardly wait to meet him.

All my love,
Christina

YIPPEE - what fun...I have one more Florida suggestion - The Boca Beach Club. 
 Here is the pitch.

*    2 easy airport to fly into: Miami and West Palm
*    The BBC compound has 4 hotels and at least five restaurants - with
an amazing tower restaurant - which would we great for a rehearsal dinner
*    The four hotels include:  Condos, tower hotel, old estate rooms, and
beach front rooms.  There is a water shuttle and complementary shuttle - that 
is very convenient to transport people around!
*    Beautiful Ball room
*    2 Golf courses
*    Tons of tennis courts
*    Multiple Pools
*    Gorgeous entrance way


We have stayed there at least ten times and always have a great time.  Just a 
thought!

THERE WILL NOT BE AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEETING ON MONDAY, OCTOBER 30
Rep. Archer did a great job today filming the spot.  Fyi, we will put it up 
on Thursday and hold a news conference that same day with  four Republican 
state reps and preview the spot for TV and the  chronicle.
?
Would you send Archer a short note thanking  him, Sharon and Don Carlson, his 
aide, for their excellent  effort?
?
Thanks. Everything is good. Our four day tracking  poll (we are tracking 
every night except friday and saturday) shows us  up 59-34. Give the 
opponents all the undecided and we are still in  shape to coast in 55-45--a 
20 point turnaround from  '99.
Sue asked me to send following  information:
?
Sylvia will hold a news conference on Tuesday to  endorse the arena. The 
press advisory sent out today will cause many of them to  think she is going 
to oppose the arena. That's good because more of the media  will show up.
?
Her basic statement will be to reinforce her  position, as the city's fiscal 
watchdog, that this will not take one dime away  from basic services and will 
indeed help the city keep growing and thus have  more funding for city 
services---especially the $13 million a  year that the Arena will generate in 
sales taxes and the increase in property  values downtown.
?
It will be great if Mr. Lay could show up at the  event and that Sylvia for 
her support and objective analysis of the arena  benefits.
Sharon:

Mr. Lay's e-mail address is kenneth.lay@enron.com

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Thank you
Flash.
?
Hotze just bought TV. Looks like 125k total  for one week. Not certain. 
Cannot tell about complete buy since it isn't in the  public file.
?
Spot will run on 11 at 5,6, 10 news and  some on Letterman. 
?
Will consider response if spot seems to be  good. Tracking polls will follow.
?
I am putting Archer on Thursday ahead of  schedule to counter.
?
Will  advise.

Subject: Invitation for IAEE Keynote


Hi Rosalee-- I just wanted to thank you so much for your extra help on our
inquiry to Ken.  We understand completely that the April 25 slot following
his return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's
always easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given recently
can easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of
my previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May to
the World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we
would work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new
content.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I
mentioned the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when it
comes to the idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy markets
and business enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and
don't hesitate to ever ask for a "quid pro quo" from us.

Good morning, Michelle -

Ken Lay said that he would be happy to be the opening keynote speaker at the 
kick off luncheon on Wednesday, April 25, 2001.

Sorry for the delay, but at least we are sure he wants to do it.

Hi Rosalee-- I just wanted to thank you so much for your extra help on our
inquiry to Ken.  We understand completely that the April 25 slot following
his return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's
always easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given recently
can easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of
my previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May to
the World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we
would work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new
content.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I
mentioned the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when it
comes to the idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy markets
and business enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and
don't hesitate to ever ask for a "quid pro quo" from us.

  6,900    26
62,695    Total.

They've told the stations that they expect to add time to the buy. But that
will be very difficult for them to do next week and it will not be all that
much any way.

The Carson "Group" is a one man operation out of a cat ridden house

Our in-house media guy says the TV is being placed by the Carson Group. The
Tv stations have said they will not tell us how much has been spent on the
buy over the phone, but they will show us in person if we send someone to
the stations. Have you found out any more information?

Subject: Duchess of Northumbria's request

Ken

Thanks for sending me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help 
with her garden project.  I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our 
view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this, we 
should say a polite "no".

The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O'Neill, 
Managing Director of Lurgi Invent.

Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really 
is difficult to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work 
for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.  However, this 
business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see 
any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent.

Given the nature of the project, the approach from the Duchess and the fact 
that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself, we really do believe no is 
the right answer.

Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to 
correspond direct with the Duchess.

Best wishes.

Colin

Dear Friends, Family and Wedding Party,
I am attaching a tentative itinerary for the wedding
weekend. Some of the times for transportation and hair
appointments may change as we finalize the schedules,
but for the most part, this should help you plan your
weekend.
We do not have a golf outing planned but I am assured
the Four Seasons and Hilton can help arrange golf
groups for wedding guests.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any
questions!
All our love,
Liz and Jose Luis

Subject: rockets season has begun


Hello dear siblings... yes, believe it or not, I  am sending one of my rare 
e-mails.?
?
I will be in charge of distributing Rocket  tickets this season for mom and 
Ken?since I successfully accomplished  baseball ticket distribution without 
having a nervous breakdown.? You all  were actually wonderful and made it 
very easy due to the rules that were set  up by the folks prior to my 
receiving that responsibility.? Organization  comes natural to me so I am 
happy to do it again so that mom has one less  thing on her plate.
?
Rules have not yet been sent out by mom and  Ken,?but I do want to get a jump 
start on the season distribution since  it is upon us already.? With 
baseball, all ticket were requested prior to  the 1st of each month, so that 
I was able to commit game tickets to family and  then to Mom and Ken's 
significant other people for that  given?month.? Tickets were requested and 
guaranteed one  month?at a time?not further out?than that.? There was also  
some sort of first come first serve rule?which I don't fully remember but  it 
also never became a problem.??All of these rules made it  work?so I suggest 
sticking to them  again?regarding?basketball.??(Mom and Ken?may null  and 
void all of this with new rules but these are my suggestions until they do  
so.)
?
There are 4 tickets grouped together on row 1 and  an additional 4 tickets 
grouped together on row 2.? So, this year we have  the pleasure of an 
additional 4 tickets at each game which should make the  rubics cube of 
ticket distribution a bit easier.
?
November games include:
?
Thursday??? ???  Nov.2?????? ?? 7:30  pm??? Milwaukee
Tuesday??? ???  ?Nov.7???????? 7:30  pm??? Los Angeles
Thursday??? ???  Nov.9?????? ?? 7:30  pm??? Vancover
Tuesday????  ??? Nov.14????????7:30  pm????Chicago
Thursday??????  Nov.16??? ??? 7:30 pm???  Charlotte
Saturday??? ???  Nov.18??? ??? 7:30 pm???  Pheonix
Tuesday??????  ? Nov. 28???????7:30  pm??? Sacramento
?
Please let me know ASAP what your requests are  for the month of November and 
I will do my best to try and make everyone  happy.? This needs to be resolved 
by friday of this week  Nov.3rd so that I am able to distribute to family and 
then start  making calls down the list of mom and Ken's significant other 
people so that  all tickets are used.? If you have not contacted me by friday 
with your  requests, I will distribute tickets so no whining is allowed if 
you don't get  what you later realize you want.? Remember FRIDAY IS THE 
DEADLINE FOR THE  MONTH OF NOVEMBER.
?
Regarding December, get your requests in now  which will be final and tickets 
will be distributed to everyone by  friday the?1st of December.
No tickets will go unused.
?
December games include:
?
Saturday??? ??? Dec  2??????????7:30  pm??? Portland

Best way to get me is by fax 713 629  5755 since I am at home with the wee 
precious ones.? I receive  faxes?instantly.? For those of you that are hipper 
than me and like  email, that is another option but?it takes a maximum?of 24 
hours for  me to receive your messages since Christophe takes the computer to

Please call with questions.

The ch 2 survey had a wider spread but I don't  think it is accurate (63-36).

The Chronicle will be calling tomorrow with their  poll numbers. Their poll 
is a creation of Dick Murray and Bob Stein. I would  expect them to show us 
in a much tighter race. These guys are not always  accurate (remember their 
60-40 against poll on baseball in '96).

 - ST Election Letter.pdf
This is a reminder of your ongoing obligation to report to the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") transactions in Lilly stock.  In light of
the complexity of the reporting rules and the potential for severe
penalties for noncompliance, please contact me in advance of any
transaction.  As a reminder, the SEC rules cover all transactions,
including:

-   purchases
-   sales
-   gifts
-   trust or partnership transactions
-   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
-   exchange fund transactions

We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two
reasons:

   There are certain times when you should not engage in market
   transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these "black-outs" occur around
   the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
   announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of "inside
   information" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our
   reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.
   While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to
   you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have
   legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.

2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.

If you had any Lilly stock transactions in October, please advise me as
soon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature
and file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").  The
reports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day
of the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am
not available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any
proposed transaction.

If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate
to call me.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Dreaded Lists

---------------------------------


Alright, it is beginning, I need to receive from all parties the lists for 
the wedding/ engagement party. I'm not sure what ettiquette is appropriate, 
i.e. if people invited to the engagement party are automatic guests at the 
wedding, but I plan on buying the book, whatever it may be. However, I would 
like to receive your lists, including family, with addresses so Jose Luis and 
I can start composing a master list. He is doing the same with his parents. I 
know, Dad and Linda, you are in the middle of moving and giong out of town, 
etc. but I can start with Mark and Natalie's list and then change as needed.
Thanks,
Love,
Liz and Jose Luis
I have approved the attached expense report for Rosalee Fleming.

Dear Friends and Family,
We are down to the wire and the race couldn't be
closer. Every vote counts, even those of you in Texas.
Please, remember to vote and go early, polls open at
7am across the country and close at 7pm but don't put
it off until 7pm as there could be lines and the
supervisors are not required to keep the polls open
after 7pm for those in line.
Remind your friends and family to vote and if someone
needs transportation to the polls, give them a ride or
call your local Victory 2000 office (Republicans) or
your local Democratic campaign office, they will have
people available to transport people to the polls.
Keep an eye out while you are at the polls for
electoral fraud and report any suspicious activity
including inappropriate campaigning to the poll
watchers at the polls. The Democrats and the
Republicans will have representatives at most of the
polls, let them know if there is suspicious activity.
Finally, if you have time, call your local offices and
offer your time to make phone calls to encourage
people to get out and vote, pass out leaflets, or to
be available to help prevent of voter fraud.

Finally, enjoy the evening and watch the results come
in. There are election watch parties everywhere!!!

Just one more day (and no more mass political e-mail's
from me and everyone else)!
Take care and VOTE!
Liz

with you when you have a chance to call.  

Rosie

and leave in time to vote!!

Dear Family and Friends,
Ken and I just cut short our Italy trip with friends to return to Houston
for the birth of our 6th grandchild (which is the final one for this round
of four pregnancies).  We were happy to return home and I am a very thankful
and thrilled grandmother (aka Momie, Mamamia, Mamia, Mia).  This was the
first live birth that I have personally witnessed since my last baby, Beau,
and it was VERY exhilarating and VERY emotional, as evidenced by the
attached photos.  I hope you will enjoy seeing my new grandson "Pate David
Herrold" (Pate was Courtney's maiden name) who was born on June 8, 2000 at
7:19 p.m.  Pate was 7 lbs, 10 ozs, 20 inches long with a lot of dark curly
hair.  I think he looks exactly like David at birth, but time will tell.
These photos were taken in the delivery room within the first 15-20 minutes
of his birth prior to being cleaned up and returned to the nursery.  He
looks pretty darn good for just having arrived into this world with such
great force.  So far, he is a VERY calm and good infant just like his Daddy
was.  Enjoy!  Big kiss and lots of love, LPL

Subject: e-Katz: Chief Kroeker


Over the past week I have heard from many thoughtful and concerned citizens
about their opinions on Chief Kroeker.  About an hour ago, I held a news
conference to release the statement below in response.  I wanted to make
sure you were able to read it in its entirety.

You are a part of my e-Katz list because of your work with me or my
administration.  To be removed from the "e-Katz" distribution list, simply
reply to this e-mail with your request.  If you have multiple e-mail
addresses you use, please include a name and/or company, otherwise we may
not be able to locate the correct entry to remove.  For more information on
the Katz administration, visit our website at
http://www.ci.portland.or.us/mayor.


Statement Regarding Police Chief Mark Kroeker

"I take my responsibilities as police commissioner very seriously.  I have
reviewed this situation with care.  I want to thank those who provided me
feedback either in person, over the telephone or through e-mail.

"The performance of any individual in my administration ultimately rests
with me.  I want to apologize for the concern, pain and fear caused by the
taped comments made years ago by Chief Kroeker.  His taped comments in no
way reflect my own personal beliefs.

"My community and staff discussions, along with reading all the e-mails and
transcripts of all my telephone messages, helped distill my thinking on this
issue to one key question: Can Chief Kroeker separate his personal religious
views from his professional conduct?

"I have determined that he manages his duties without bias and will continue
to do so. His performance has met my expectations.  He is leading the bureau
in a fair, respectful and inclusive manner.  He is moving our law
enforcement efforts to a higher level of community policing.  Therefore, I
have asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief of Police.  He has my strong
support to continue.

"The law provides that all city employees have a right to their personal
religious views.  I have a responsibility to review their employment status
if their actions, as a result of their personal views, impair their ability
to perform their professional responsibilities.

"Many of the arguments raised asking me to dismiss Mark Kroeker because he
is "out of step with Portland" could be used in other Oregon communities to
fire more liberal public officials who are "out of step" with their
community's conservative majority.  My 30-year fight for tolerance goes both
ways.

"Chief Kroeker will have to rebuild trust with many of our citizens.   He
assures me he is prepared to do so.  He told me he would rather help undo
the damage, help me promote tolerance and acceptance of all people, than
just walk away.

"He commits to a strong and sustained positive dialogue with Portlanders who
are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, including those on his staff.
He has already begun outreach efforts and will continue to do so.

"He said he will redouble his efforts to promote respect and acceptance of
all Portlanders and be steadfast and fair in his enforcement of the law.

"He agrees to work with the Cascade Aids Project to serve as a spokesperson
to educate citizens about the fact that AIDS is not a "gay disease."

"He will continue to seek advice from the City Council, the Bureau's Sexual
Minority Roundtable and others to guide additional efforts.

"He agrees to take all this on with all his heart.

"In the process I hope he and we all learn from this experience.  I will
work to turn this negative situation into a positive one: to expand our
sense of tolerance; to promote the notion that regardless of a person's
personal or religious beliefs, one can be an effective public servant; and
to deepen the acceptance of all Portlanders.

"As Mayor, I will do my part and more.  I hope you will join me."




From Ken Lay -

Ken said "Get word back to Lucie that 6 or 7, but would prefer 6 and add an 
extra special 7th meeting during the year if it's needed".

Subject: Board Metting Dates



Mike has suggested that we cut back  board meetings to fewer than the eight 
(8) we currently hold.? In order to  give you some background, Linda checked 
other peer companies and the meetings  range from 6 to 8 a year.? 
?
I think that we can cut back to 6,  however it may be more prudent to drop to 
7 this year and first see how it goes  .? The two meetings that can be 
dropped most easily are June or  September.? 
?
June,  because we have the two day strat  plan meeting in July, and Sept. 
because we don't yet have 4th quarter results  and not a lot of new 
information is available.
?
I think that the board meetings take up   an incredible amount of Compaq 
executive time and energy. I would rather have  them concentrate on getting 6 
or 7 meetings right, getting the company back on  track and? increasing 
earnings.? So, my vote is to?recommend to the board that we  eliminate the 
September '01 meeting.? That is a particularly busy month for  many people as 
exhibited by the lack of attendance we had at this past September  meeting (5 
members).? In looking back, we seem to be able to "fill the  house" in June.
?
On the other hand, you all may want to  continue with the number of meetings 
we currently have.? I will await your  reply.
?
Regards,
?

Dear Family,
As you can see below, at 90 years young, Daddy (aka Pop-Pop) has his own
e-mail address and can be reached online.  I am sure that he would love to
hear from you from time-to-time.  I'm sure he would especially like to be
updated with recent photos of you and your families...me too!  If you have
any other family members e-mail addresses, let me know.  Big Kiss.  Love,
Linda/Mom/Aunt Linda

your message came through ok i  will send you more later.
On Tuesday, July 25, I am meeting with Molecular Electronics Corp. (MEC) to 
discuss the opportunity for establishing this newly formed company in 
Houston.  For those of you that are not familiar with MEC, they are 
considered one of the premier companies in the area of molecular computing.  
MEC has approached Enron to discuss a possible alliance that would facilitate 
their development and, in particular, location in the Houston area.  MEC 
represents the frontier of computing technology.

I would like to invite you to participate in a working lunch discussion of 
the opportunities and obstacles facing a company that is seeking to change an 
industry.  I would appreciate it if you could join us on July 25  from 11:30 
to 1:30 in EB49C1 for this informal roundtable with the CEO of MEC, Harvey 
Plotnick and one of the founders, Jim Tour.

Will you please let Vanessa Groscrand know if you can attend at 713-853-1769 
or please reply by e-mail to me.

Dear Family,
Heather and I were talking about NYC and thought we
should make some reservations for dinner for the
entire family on Friday and Saturday night. I am
trying to get reservations for the entire family at Le
Cirque 2000 for Friday night at 7:30 but we will be
very lucky to get in. Does anyone have other
suggestions or an objection to Le Cirque? I am
attaching a review of the restaurant. It is definitely
a little "Haute" but I've heard it is also a lot of
fun. Heather is looking into Italian restaurants for
Saturday night, as well.

This is just a suggestion but we were worried that we
may have difficutly getting into a good restaurant if
we wait too long. Also, I think I am just a little
excited about the trip!
Luv to all
Liz

The Verdict
The highest of the city's high-society restaurants.

Tip Sheet
One of New York's Best
Nominated for best dessert and for best French
restaurant, this aptly-named restaurant provides the
city's most carnivalesque dinner experience.
Can't Wait?
Peruse Le Cirque 2000's blockbuster wine list now.

Also Nominated for Best French Restaurant
Daniel, Chanterelle, Jean Georges, Le Bernardin

Also Nominated for Best Dessert
Gramercy Tavern, Payard Patisserie, Jean Georges, Park
Avenue Cafe

The Scene
Uber-designer Adam Tihany's (Jean Georges, among
others) surreal interior evokes simultaneous thoughts
of the Sistine Chapel and "The Jetsons." Purple,
one-armed velvet chairs, neon tubing and
stainless-steel sculptures compete for attention with
the soaring, gilded ceilings, pre-Raphaelite murals
and bejeweled patrons. Ringleader Sirio Maccioni
oversees a front-of-house that has won praise for
softening the haughty edge that marked the
restaurant's pre-Y2K incarnation.

The Food
Still some of the most sublime haute cuisine around.
Though longtime sous chef Sotta Kuhnn is now heading
the kitchen=01*having succeeded Sylvain Portay (who took
over for Daniel Boulud)=01*the luxurious,
truffle-and-foie-gras-studded fare remains as sharp as
ever. The current menu includes the long-running
paupiette of sea bass with Barolo sauce and leeks, as
well a sauteed veal chop with bacon-wrapped asparagus.
Patrons can take decision-making out of the picture
entirely with the five-course chef's degustation menu,
a bargain at $90.

Linda, before we knew that you and Ken were going to the VIP reception, Ken 
had me ask if others could attend in your place.  I did ask and they have 
just called me that Nancy Kinder said that it is o.k. for the Vermeils and 
the Herrolds to attend, in addition to you and Ken.  They did ask if we would 
not spread it around as others have asked and they have not let them.

Oh, but Beau just called that Heather is ill and they are cancelling.

Subject: Breakfast in New York


On Feb. 27, 2001 RFF Board member Dod Fraser will host a breakfast in New
York to introduce us to potential donors (corporate, foundation and
individual) and Board members in the area.  If you have names of people you
would like to invite to this event, please send them to me (with contact
information) at your earliest convenience.  We appreciate your assistance in
helping us expand our circle of friends.  I look forward to hearing from
you!


Dear Dad and Mark,
I am attaching the first draft of my resume in hopes
that you may be able to provide suggestions on making
it even better. Also, if you have any ideas on
contacts in Miami for work, that would be great. I am
going to routes in looking for a job, one money, one
love. The money route will be with a law firm or
preferrably a company looking of counsel for
government relations, energy background, etc.  The
second track will be on the more dolphin hugging side
such as marine conservation groups.
Let me know you thoughts.
I love you both,
Liz Vittor

Jose Luis is planning on flying into Miami on the afternoon of October 1 
(Friday). I am planning on meeting him there and staying at whichever hotel 
we think it the likely candidate. If possible, I would like for you all to go 
with us so I can get your opinions as well (not to mention a ride). Then, we 
can fly back to Houston around lunch time and be here for Saturday night and 
Sunday. Saturday night is the SPCA ball and it appears it may also be the 
only night we will be able to attend a party.  Let me know your thoughts 
about having the engagement party on that night????

Dad,
Just wanted to give you some more to think about. What
I would really like to find is a job that combines my
interest in politics, my legislative skills, with my
passion for marine conservation.  This can expand to
environmental conservation.

The number one corporate target for me is the
Discovery Channel in Miami. They do have a fairly
significant office there and I am going to try and
make contacts at Discovery.

One option I am considering is working on the Bush
campaign from now until November in hopes during that
time I will make contacts in South Florida.
Unfortunately, they are not doing a significant amount
of work in South Florida.

I'll be around this weekend and would appreciate any
input.
I love you!
Elizabeth

Gary, 
Least I forget!  On N5737 the other day (11/18) Mr. Lay reported to Bill 
Reddick that when his phone (#2 R/H seat) rings and he answers that it 
disconnects on him.  He told Bill that this is the third time he has reported 
this problem.  I spoke personally with Bill about this.  We checked and there 
is no record of this problem reported recently (we checked back to May 2000) 
on all three Falcon 900's.

Lyndel checked the system and there does seem to be a problem with it 
disconnecting if you pick it up before the third ring.  After the third ring 
it works fine.  That is all I know at this time.  Garrett Av is coming over 
today to check the system.

I know you don't like emails but I didn't want this it slip by.  I've 
discussed this with Ron and John as well.

Subject: New Administration


Ken,

Sorry to miss you today when I called. Since I am leaving for India in a
few minutes, I thought I would sent you an E-mail, and then I can try to
call you from India. Because of the time difference, it will not be easy
for us to connect. Unfortunately I will not be back in the US until
December 7.

The reason for my call was to see if you would feel comfortable putting my
name forward to Dick Cheney for a position in the new administration. I am
not sure where the best fit would be, but it might be Chairman of the
National Economic Council. That job has a good combination of management
and economics. You know I have only been associated with Democratic
administrations in past, but Democratic administrations were a little
different in those days. You are somewhat familiar with my record on
economics and there is a lot on that in the public domain.

Just let me know what you think. Maybe a quick E-mail would suffice ( I am
carrying my computer).

Best regards,
Bill

Dictated letter from Ken Lay

Dear John:

I enjoyed your recent e-mail.  I also appreciate your kind comments 
concerning our broadband activity.  The deal with Blockbuster has been a 
great deal of fun and is opening up all kinds of additional opportunities.

I enjoyed looking through the agenda for your meeting in Sweden.  It looks 
quite informative and interesting.  Sweden is also an excellent place for a 
summer conference.

The young man you refer to in your letter should send his resume to Celeste 
Roberts at (713) 853-0555.  If he would also copy me on the letter to 
Celeste, I would be happy to follow up and make sure it is carefully 
considered.

I'm delighted that your life appears to be going very well at the current 
time.  I hope our paths will again cross in Aspen or elsewhere in the not too 
distant future.

Warm regards,

Ken
Ken wanted me to let you know that he has something in Austin the night 
before and wanted to find out what time the event in Cornell begins.

Ken and Jeff,

As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the 
Enron Associate program for several years now.  I also recently have become 
involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which 
provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.  They 
are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will 
include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their 
company's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to 
ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would 
really highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a "Core School" in 
the MBA recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for 
March 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.

Kevin

Kevin-


Just a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding Enron's
participation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week and the
possibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had a
chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on
you plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. 
Below is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all
is well with you.


            Nov.2 email text


We at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link
with Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the
agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable
markets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like
Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic
Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and
beyond.


The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. 
First, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key
speaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As
described in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three
conferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and
students.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a "live
case study" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,
2001</underline>.


You, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this
is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay
and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and
the Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the
corporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken
Chenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced
President of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a
distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in
continually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  


We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership
Week, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman
Sachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company
and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank
Rhodes, but these are still long shots.


The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the
Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted
a platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If
they can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the
date is March 28, 2001.       


The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same
lines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it
could become the basis for the March conference live case study
presentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to
literally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage
an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place
that you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to
be the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and
practices make this possible.


I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around
1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and
leadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to
building this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer
from the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the
Enron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast
moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient
way.


Kevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and
hopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to
make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. 
Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As
always, thanks for your great personal support.


Dick




Letter dictated by Ken Lay

Gene:

 I appreciated the update on your health status.  It appears you are taking a 
very tough situation and, with help from some of the best doctors in the 
world, setting about to turn it around.  I'm sure it goes without saying that 
you know we are all pulling for you and betting on a positive outcome.

 Clearly your health is the number one issue now.  To the extent you want to 
work and can work, we are delighted to have you back in the office.  But that 
is a very distant secondary concern until you get everything done about your 
health that can be done.  If there is any way I or Enron can be of any 
further help, please let me know.

This is a reminder of your ongoing obligation to report to the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") transactions in Lilly stock.  In light of
the complexity of the reporting rules and the potential for severe
penalties for noncompliance, please contact me in advance of any
transaction.  As a reminder, the SEC rules cover all transactions,
including:

-   purchases
-   sales
-   gifts
-   trust or partnership transactions
-   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
-   exchange fund transactions

We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two
reasons:

   There are certain times when you should not engage in market
   transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these "black-outs" occur around
   the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
   announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of "inside
   information" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our
   reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.
   While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to
   you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have
   legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.

2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.

If you had any Lilly stock transactions in November, please advise me as
soon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature
and file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").  The
reports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day
of the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am
not available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any
proposed transaction.

If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate
to call me.  Thank you for your cooperation.

It was a pleasure speaking with you on Wednesday.  Based on our conversatio=

to remove those impediments.

A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR=01,s ability=

designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20
monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t=

the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20
offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o=
f=20
distributed generation.

Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20
investor-owned and municipal utilities

Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =
a=20
step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20
interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=
=20
requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20
generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=
=20
interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=
=20
through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20
possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=
e=20
utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20
accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.

Permitting and Air Quality Issues
Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=
 or=20

In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=
=20
face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20
interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=

These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.

e=20
goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.
However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=
=20
concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.
We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=
redit=20
risk concerns.
Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=
=20
is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=
=20
both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=
=20
going forward.

Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue

Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority
The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20
charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=
=20
analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20
California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =
As=20
such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=
es=20
adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.

Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018
The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=
=20
=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=
use to=20
allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20
purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=
ee=20
to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=
=20
DWR has entered into with suppliers.
=20
Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=
=20
Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases
In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=
=20
noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=
=20
the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=
oy to=20
permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=
s=20
extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=
re=20
DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =
is=20
difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=
=20
rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=
=20
costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=
=20
suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=
=20
from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.

Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20

We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=
sk=20
issues.  We have identified three options:

Amend AB1X
The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=
=20
PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=
red by=20
DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =
to=20
ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=
=20
preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=
=20
challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20
entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)

Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20
through Contract Language
This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20
implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=
re=20
time to implement than the "legislative" fix.  We have attached electronic=
=20
copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=
=20
would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20
=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)

Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk
As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=
cept=20
other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=
=20
cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=
=20
indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=
=20
prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=
=20
contract amendments.

4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001

Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20
Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=
=20
showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=
r=20
only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=
l=20
credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=
=20
of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20
likely. =20

CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20
summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20
estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=
 well=20
below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=
n=20
in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=
=20
than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20
unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=
o=20
date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=
he=20
flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20
California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =
this=20
requirement. =20

Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=
=20
draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=
re=20
supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=
=20
number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20
utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=
t=20
pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=
=20
added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.

CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=
=20
rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20
optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=
=20
MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=
=20
should view the CEC's "rosy scenario" with considerable skepticism.

5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=
=01,s=20
Electricity Crisis

This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=
l=20
deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=
=20
bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.

As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20
crisis must focus on four issues:

Increase supply
Decrease demand
Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market
Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency

Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)
To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =
=20
Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=
=20
than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.

The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=
slation=20
are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=
se=20
efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=
=20
in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20
requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=
=20
proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20
transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20
innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20
emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=
ir=20
districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20
required reductions in pollution emissions.

Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)
Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=
=20
the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=
=20
best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=
st=20
effectively and quickly in two ways:

Buy-down demand
California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=
d=20
to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=
 more=20
economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=
ld=20
be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=
=20
through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20
determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20
participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20
necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20
reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=
eal=20
Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.

Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment
To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:

An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=
=20
for hour-ahead power in real time.=20
Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=
=20
verification.
Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=
=20
paid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).

The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=
e:

=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=
cularly=20
in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=
=20
resources.
reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20
electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =
in=20
the state.
fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=
k=20
of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20
customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=
=20
responding.=20

We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=
=20
excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=
=20
summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate=
=20
that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=
s=20
that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20
directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20
control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.

Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=
cle:=20
SB27X
The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=
re=20
customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=
=20
service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=
=20
customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=
e=20
prohibition against Direct Access.

Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=
=20
direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o=
f=20
Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from=
=20
customer migration. =20

In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=
=20
the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme=
nt=20
is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20
condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20
therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20
function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20
non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ=
ia=20
should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period =
in=20
which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments=
=20
of utility load.

Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative =
vehicle:=20
AB18X
Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand=
. =20
In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20
imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers=
=20
and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ=
ia=20
State government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend=
ed=20
period of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=
e=20
in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20
participate in that market.

California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=
=20
series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20
increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without=
=20
=01&shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California c=
ould=20
amortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year perio=
d. =20
In addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:=
=20
First, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in=20
recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of =
AB=20
1890.  Second, California can =01&net=018 the revenues the utilities have r=

Hi Jeanine -

I have checked with Jeff Skilling's office and he is not available on June 
26.  May we go back to the drawing board?  We can offer some time in the 
afternoon of August 7, 8 or 9 - possibly 2:00 p.m. on one of those days.  
Those dates are currently good for Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling and Dave Delainey.  
Please advise at your earliest convenience.

Rosalee
Eric, sorry for the delay.  It's a busy morning.

Good morning, Jean - 

I understand from Rob Bradley that you are putting together some facts for 
Ken as he is moderator of this panel tomorrow in Austin.  He said that he 
would like some bullet points about basic trend data last five years re:  
natural gas production and oil production in the State.  He also would like 
facts about electricity transmission and any copies of articles about the 
subject.

Thanks.

Subject: Governors Conference




Dear Ken, 

It was good to talk with you last week, and I hope you got some vacation in 
Aspen.? I'm working at it! 

Rosalie said you'd be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you 
by phone or e-mail before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you.? 
Governor Knowles (classmate of George W.), along with Governor Taft of Ohio, 
has enlisted us in a conference that seven governors are sponsoring on 
natural gas in order to elucidate the market and issues -- and needs -- 
before it explodes as a political issue -- and perhaps helps head it off (in 
contrast to what happened with gasoline).? Governor Knowles is the current 
chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be under the 
auspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and a lot of 
other distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very timely event.

They would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be kicking 
off the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high visibility 
platform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and honored -- to have 
you in that featured role in it works for your schedule.

It takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. 

Tony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms very 
large for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill you in 
further on what they would like to accomplish.

If it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, 
that would be great. 

On behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. 

Best, 

Dan

Hey there,

I just called your dad and congratulated the "father of the bride"  He was 
VERY cute and walked me through his conversation with JL and his thoughts on 
Florida...FUN FUN FUN - He is so proud of you and thinks so highly of JL - I 
can hardly wait to meet him.

All my love,

YIPPEE - what fun...I have one more Florida suggestion - The Boca Beach Club. 
 Here is the pitch.

*    2 easy airport to fly into: Miami and West Palm
*    The BBC compound has 4 hotels and at least five restaurants - with
an amazing tower restaurant - which would we great for a rehearsal dinner
*    The four hotels include:  Condos, tower hotel, old estate rooms, and
beach front rooms.  There is a water shuttle and complementary shuttle - that 
is very convenient to transport people around!
*    Beautiful Ball room
*    2 Golf courses
*    Tons of tennis courts
*    Multiple Pools
*    Gorgeous entrance way


We have stayed there at least ten times and always have a great time.  Just a 
thought!

i.e. if people invited to the engagement party are automatic guests at the 
wedding, but I plan on buying the book, whatever it may be. However, I would 
like to receive your lists, including family, with addresses so Jose Luis and 
I can start composing a master list. He is doing the same with his parents. I

Dear Friends, Family and Wedding Party,
I am attaching a tentative itinerary for the wedding
weekend. Some of the times for transportation and hair
appointments may change as we finalize the schedules,
but for the most part, this should help you plan your
weekend.
We do not have a golf outing planned but I am assured
the Four Seasons and Hilton can help arrange golf
groups for wedding guests.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any
questions!
All our love,

Dear Dad and Mark,
I am attaching the first draft of my resume in hopes
that you may be able to provide suggestions on making
it even better. Also, if you have any ideas on
contacts in Miami for work, that would be great. I am
going to routes in looking for a job, one money, one
love. The money route will be with a law firm or
preferrably a company looking of counsel for
government relations, energy background, etc.  The
second track will be on the more dolphin hugging side
such as marine conservation groups.
Let me know you thoughts.
I love you both,

Dad,
Just wanted to give you some more to think about. What
I would really like to find is a job that combines my
interest in politics, my legislative skills, with my
passion for marine conservation.  This can expand to
environmental conservation.

The number one corporate target for me is the
Discovery Channel in Miami. They do have a fairly
significant office there and I am going to try and
make contacts at Discovery.

One option I am considering is working on the Bush
campaign from now until November in hopes during that
time I will make contacts in South Florida.
Unfortunately, they are not doing a significant amount
of work in South Florida.

I'll be around this weekend and would appreciate any
input.
I love you!

Since you left for India, and in case I forget to tell you, I asked to have a 
new banking rep to replace Howard Williams for LPL Prop & Interiors.  Since I 
was doing this, both Sally and Sherrie felt it best to have all of our 
business with one person rather than dealing with two.  So, we will now be 
dealing with Margaret Barradas who is Howard's superior.  Where James Shelton 
was a hard act to follow, Howard should be a piece of cake.  Anyone merely 
pleasant and respectful would be an upgrade to Howard and hopefully our new 
rep will fill the bill.   Love, L.

Dear Family and Friends,
Ken and I just cut short our Italy trip with friends to return to Houston
for the birth of our 6th grandchild (which is the final one for this round
of four pregnancies).  We were happy to return home and I am a very thankful
and thrilled grandmother (aka Momie, Mamamia, Mamia, Mia).  This was the
first live birth that I have personally witnessed since my last baby, Beau,
and it was VERY exhilarating and VERY emotional, as evidenced by the
attached photos.  I hope you will enjoy seeing my new grandson "Pate David
Herrold" (Pate was Courtney's maiden name) who was born on June 8, 2000 at
7:19 p.m.  Pate was 7 lbs, 10 ozs, 20 inches long with a lot of dark curly
hair.  I think he looks exactly like David at birth, but time will tell.
These photos were taken in the delivery room within the first 15-20 minutes
of his birth prior to being cleaned up and returned to the nursery.  He
looks pretty darn good for just having arrived into this world with such
great force.  So far, he is a VERY calm and good infant just like his Daddy
was.  Enjoy!  Big kiss and lots of love, LPL

e-mail address and can be reached online.  I am sure that he would love to
hear from you from time-to-time.  I'm sure he would especially like to be
updated with recent photos of you and your families...me too!  If you have
any other family members e-mail addresses, let me know.  Big Kiss.  Love,
Linda/Mom/Aunt Linda

and will get him to Aspen as soon as the smoke clears.  He is burning the

Dear Linda,
So much for your quieter time of life.
After seeing the NY Times article yesterday, I am glad for Enron that
Ken is back at the helm; I trust he will persevere and be more than
successful in whatever he does.
I am concerned about his level of stress, and would highly recommend
that he keep up that anxiety control formula, taking two after meals
3x a day. I have stronger things in my arsenal if needed.
Also, perhaps when he is here sometime, I could check his blood
chemistry for stress factors and optimal brain function.
Warmest Regards,
Phyllis

"In quietness and confidence is your strength."  --  Isaiah 30:15

	A missionary in India was kneeling at his bed praying one night when a
giant python snake uncoiled itself from the rafters and wrapped itself
around his body.  The python, which is not uncommon in India, kills its
victim by squeezing it to death.  The missionary told how a Bible verse
immediately came to mind as the meandering serpent enveloped his body.  "In
quietness and confidence is your strength."  And suddenly he was filled with
the calm assurance that God was in control!  He remained perfectly still,
praying and meditating like he never had before!

	Had he struggled, hesitated or tensed up, the coils of the mighty creature
would have constricted and crushed him!  Instead he waited, prayed, stayed
calm and didn't move a muscle.  Slowly, the snake uncoiled itself and
retreated back to the rafters.

	Most of us admire that kind of quiet COURAGE.  I don't believe there is a
value that is more recognizable and admirable in a human life than courage.
Claim the courage that is yours as a child of God.  God wants you to be
courageous!


I AM MADE FOR CONFIDENT, COURAGEOUS LIVING.  TODAY, I CAN FEEL MY FEARS
SLIPPING AWAY AS GOD FILLS ME WITH COURAGE!

I Love you.

Linda

During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

We thought you might be interested in this ISIS press release regarding the compound we are developing with ISIS for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.
 

 - ISIS 3521 - AACR.NCI.EORTC Meeting - 10.29.doc 

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.
As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

The attached news release was sent out via Business Wire at approximately 4:00 p.m. today. 

 - Bioterrorism release.doc 

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

The attached news releases were issued via Business Wire at 7:00 a.m. (Indpls time) today.

My dearest precious men,

"Be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart, all you who hope in
the Lord."  - Psalm 31:24

Courage belongs to those who know God, says the psalmist.  And, I say we all
need to continually affirm God's power to protect us.  Today I have created
a litany which affirms our faith in God's power, so that we need never be
afraid.  Since our current situation strikes fear in our hearts, read this
litany of courage and praise.  You need never be afraid!

	When I am being tested beyond measure in my job responsibilities ...
		I will put my trust in God.
	When I am facing the greatest hurdles of my life...
		The Lord gives me courage!
	When I feel like I am completely alone...
		The Lord is my light and salvation!
	When I feel like the bottom is falling out...
		My heart shall know no fear!  God will save me!
	When I have no other answers or solutions...
		God will send the help I need!
	When I go through every terrifying minute of the day...
		I am expecting the Lord to rescue me!
	When I think failure is upon me...
		I am brave, for God's power is greater than any situation I could possibly
face today.


"FEAR NOT, FOR I HAVE REDEEMED YOU; I HAVE CALLED YOU BY YOUR NAME, KEN AND
BEAU, YOU ARE MINE.  WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE WATERS AND GREAT TROUBLE I WILL
BE WITH YOU.  WHEN YOU GO THROUGH RIVERS, THEY SHALL NOT OVERFLOW YOU.  WHEN
YOU WALK THROUGH THE FIRE YOU SHALL NOT BE BURNED, NOR THE FLAME SCORCH YOU.
FOR I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD, YOUR SAVIOR...YOU ARE PRECIOUS IN MY SIGHT, YOU
HAVE BEEN HONORED, AND I HAVE LOVED YOU.  FEAR NOT, FOR I AM WITH YOU."
Isaiah 43:1-5

The bottom line of our life should be faith, not fear, so live today
controlled by God-inspired positive thoughts!!!

Love and prayer, Linda/Mom

I want to remind each of you to attend the Enron Employee Meeting tomorrow at 10 a.m. in the Hyatt Regency Imperial Ballroom.  I hope to introduce many of you at the meeting, so please plan to sit up front.  Seats will be held for you.

This will be a very important meeting.  I look forward to seeing you there.

Regards,
Ken

P.S. Remember to bring your badges -- security will be checking to ensure only employees are allowed in.
The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.


I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.
Dear Sally,

I spoke w/Ken this weekend and he said that to cut costs, he would prefer to
move his current furniture into his new office.  Please contact whoever you
need to and advise me of what they think.  Linda

Dear Family,

Please see the attached schedules for preseason and regular games for the
Houston Rockets through November.  Because we all have very busy lives and
find it impossible to confirm too far in advance, I will wait closer to each
game before distributing tickets.  Also, Ken's schedule is a moving target
and it would make it much easier for him to squeeze in at least one game
this year, if we could do it on shorter notice.  Our eight basketball seats
are amazing and the tickets are a hot item, so hopefully everyone will try
to make this work and have fun doing it.

I will wait at least seven days before each game to distribute the tickets.
If you have any interest in pre-selecting certain games that you definitely
want to attend, please advise me and I will put your name on the list with
an * next to it.  Additionally, if you think you know your schedule and
would like to be considered in the ticket distribution for certain games, I
will put your name on the list with a ? next to your name.  Once your name
is on the list and as each game gets closer, I would appreciate it if you
would contact me ASAP when you find out that you are unable to attend.
Everyone has said that they want to be fair and rotate, so that each family
member has a shot at attending a game and getting both kinds of tickets.
Hopefully, we can all work it out.  However, in the event that we have more
requests than tickets for the same game, and we are unable to settle it, I
will have Barb pull names out of a hat.  Once you confirm your attendance,
tickets can be put in an envelope with your name on them and sent down to
the doorman at the Huntingdon for you to pick up.

For any games where our immediate family is not able to use the tickets,
they will be distributed to other lucky recipients in a rotating order.  I
will have Barb draw your names and ours out of a hat to create the rotation.
If you have other family members or someone special that you would like to
offer tickets to, let me know.  I can either contact you and have you
contact them or you can give me their names and contact information and Barb
will contact them directly, as you wish.

In the event that I am traveling or cannot be reached, please contact Barb
as she will be copied in on all current schedules and have access to the
tickets.  GO ROCKETS!

Love, Mom/Linda

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors. To read the full earnings press release, go to www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases.

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
 
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.
 
David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function.  The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.  Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.
 
Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will have responsibility for Employee Relations and Corporate Responsibility, which includes Social Responsibility, Community Relations, Diversity, Employee Relations, Redeployment, Alumni Relations, Employee Events and Programs, Benefits, Wellness, and Worklife.
 
Mary Joyce, Vice President, will continue to have responsibility for Executive and Corporate Compensation in addition to Global Employee Information Management and Reporting and Analysis.
 
David, Cindy and Mary will each report to the Office of the Chairman.  A detailed organizational chart is attached.  Please join me in congratulating David, Cindy and Mary on their new responsibilities.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=
. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=
r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=
 in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=
pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=
se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=
istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=
rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=
bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=
ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=
sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=
ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=
eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=
 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=
 as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=
gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=
ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi=
stration" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=
t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=
sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=
torically been asking domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, =
but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=
 would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=
urrent lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=
ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.


As you know, the Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.  

This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.  Now,  more than ever,  it is fitting to bring Enron's leaders together.  After all, it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times.  Together, we will define Enron's character and determine Enron's destiny.

We have a great program planned for this year's conference.  I'm delighted that General Norman Schwarzkopf will join us as a keynote speaker on leadership.  I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success.  As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things in store for us.

I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting.

Regards,
Ken Lay

Dear All,

Just to advise everyone that Liz and JL will be arriving late for Pop-Pop's
dinner on Friday, October 12, because she is chairing an event that evening.
Her event is billed until 7:30 p.m. but due to the fact that she is a chair
she won't be able to leave until it is over.  Therefore, we will not take
the big group photo until they arrive.  Thanks,  Linda, Mom
Dear Family,

Just for everyone's information, there is no special dress code.  Dinner
will remain casual to casual/chic, as usual.  We have scheduled Allen Ross
to be there early in the evening to help us take a few very special group
photographs.  Because of this we are providing VERY SIMPLE NON-SCAREY
Halloween costumes for the wee ones to put on over their casual attire for
photos.

I don't want to make this a difficult or painful process and the costumes
will hopefully make it fun.  The most important photograph I am hoping to
get is with "Pop-Pop and his six great grandchildren."  If that goes well,
Pop-Pop will step out and Mamia and Papi will step in quickly to be
photographed with all of their precious grandchildren.  Then depending on
whether the wee ones can handle it and don't have melt down, we would also
love for the five children and spouses to quickly join in for a larger group
shot.  If it works, it works...and it doesn't, it doesn't.  NO BIG DEAL!
We'll just see how it goes.

If all goes well, once we have finished with our special photo session, any
of you who may want individual photographs taken are on your own to do so as
you wish.

I hope this answers all of the questions Barb's early e-mail might have
sparked.  If not, call me.

Love, Mamia

With the possibility of selling house #2, is house #1 off limits?  I  have talked to all of my friends about whether they have purchased their tickets  which they all have.  I have one group going on one trip and another group  going on another all in early 2002.  I will tell my friends to try to  get refunds on their tickets if possible.  I know that even though the  house is on the market there is a chance you will still own it then.
 
However, if number one is available it will solve my January 23- Feb 4  trip, which is three other couples and no kids.  However, the March 6-18 is  three couples and their kids.  I could fit all of them in House 3 as  were planning on doing anyway, but then my family doesn't have anywhere to  stay.  Jessica and Shawn are staying in #1.  If they are not using the  entire house do you think they would mind if only my family stayed with  them.  We would stay in the back house so they wouldn't even know we were  there.  If it imposes on them, by no means would we want to do that.   I could look into putting my family up into a hotel.
 
Anyway, if it doesn't work out it is no big deal, honestly.  I am  truly thankful for all that you and Ken do.  I don't want to inconvenience  anyone, especially you and Ken.  I just want to be fair to my  friends so they can do whatever they need to do to make other arrangements  or try for refunds.

Dear All,

Sally's recommendation to include Joannie is necessary to make sure everyone
knows "The Plan" for the Enron board dinner and any other future Enron/Lay
joint function that Ken and I might host.  Let's set a meeting date for near
future.  A party check list needs to be made and agreed on by all.  Below
are some outstanding items that need to be addressed:

	 1.	Invitation list beyond board members and spouses.  (KLL needs to
determine this ASAP.)
	 2. 	Decide on a consistent "Theme" that will tie everything together.  (I
am leaning toward "Patriotic.")
	 3. 	Choose an invitation from Events.
	 4.	Decide on a holiday gift for board members. (Received great gift ideas
from Tori and Barb; Ken and I will 			decide on something this weekend.)
	 5. 	Spouse gifts are on hold.  (It's a Radko ornament w/proceeds going to
terrorist relief effort.  Sally, send an e-		mail attachment copy to
everyone to see.)
	 6. 	Choose appropriate paper and ribbon for gift wrapping.
	 7.	Choose two separate items for males and females to pick that will
determine their respective dinner table.
	 8. 	Decide on table cloths, overlays and napkins.
	 9. 	Decide on table centerpiece arrangements.
	10.	Decide on other floral/holiday items needed.
	11.	Decide on tree decorations.
	12.	Pick a caterer and menu. (Maybe ask three caterers for menu
suggestions, pick the best from each and have them 		prepare the entire meal
for a committee to decide.)
	13.	Decide on what the pre-party lobby entertainment should be and reserve
it.
	14.	Confirm whether Sally has reserved the piano player, Bob Henchen (Sp?).
	15. 	Decide on Father Christmas and reserve him.

Thanks, Linda

Linda -- would it work to include Joannie in your meeting w/Barb and
Jessica?  I think it would be beneficial to her to hear all the details
and planning that goes on, as well as getting a good feel for what you
like and expect.  She would also get to see the physical location which
would help.

Dear Family and Friends,

Ken and I have invited my father and his two lady friends (Cathy Hofgren and
Mary Walsh) to visit us at the Huntingdon in Houston for a long weekend.
The visit has been scheduled for late Thursday evening, October 11 until the
afternoon of Monday, October 15.  Unless the horrific events of the past two
weeks and it's aftermath causes some unforeseen problem, we will move
forward with their visit.  Pop-Pop is anxious to "catch up" and see everyone
in the family and some of our friends; he particularly wants to see his
precious great grand children.  Considering his age and the difficulty in
the logistics for him to see everyone, we are planning one big "extended"
family/friends casual dinner for Friday, October 12 @5:30 p.m. in the Pool
Room @River Oaks Country Club.  Mark your calendars and hopefully, most of
you will be available to join us.

I am aware of two noteworthy events in October; the first is Sharon Lay's
birthday on October 8th and the second is Halloween.  Therefore, if Sharon
is able to attend, we will have a Halloween birthday party.  With Halloween
as our theme, we will have "FRIENDLY" costumes for all children attending
and games to play.

Jessica will be e-mailing you with a guest list and getting a definite head
count, as we get closer to Pop-Pop's arrival.  If any of you have other
family members or friends who would enjoy seeing Pop-Pop and/or celebrating
Sharon's birthday and you would like for them to join us, please let me
know.

Lots of Love, Mom/Linda


Dear Joannie,

The ornament is fantastic and very appropriate this year.  We will need to
get an exact head count for the Enron order.  The corporate secretary
usually gives me an exact directors list and then Ken is the one that
decides which of his executives are invited to the dinner and Rosie provides
me with a list.

Additionally, I would like 15 ornaments for my personal use that I would
like to get ordered ASAP.  Is your source giving you a discount and if so,
how much?  I have several sources for getting discounts on most items,
including Radko ornaments, that I use every year.  Let's compare prices.
Thank you.  Linda

I had a vendor send this to me.  It is a special Radko ornament he
designed in remembrance of the recent disasters in NY and Washington.
The proceeds from the sell of this are going to the relief efforts.  I
thought it might be of interest to you as a possible holiday gift.  The
cost is around $30.  The problem is, we would need to reserve some by

We learned today that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has modified its opinion of August 9, 2000 in which it found the 2003 Prozac patent invalid for double patenting.  In essence, the Court has again ruled that the patent is invalid for double patenting, but has used a different analysis to reach this conclusion.   
We intend to seek legal review of today's decision.  Although it is possible that the legal review process could delay Barr from entering the market on August 3, we continue to plan for Barr launching generic fluoxetine at that time. 
On a related note, in our current litigation with Zenith/Reddy-Cheminor, Zenith used the prior Barr decision to allege that the olanzapine patent was invalid for double patenting. The reversal of the August 9 decision removes that argument from Zenith's presentation of its case.   
Attached to this message are copies of press releases issued by Lilly and Barr regarding the CAFC's decision. 
    
Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any questions in this regard.

To my dearest precious husband,

Please reread every word of this and do it because you love me.

"Be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart, all you who hope in
the Lord."  - Psalm 31:24

Courage belongs to those who know God, says the psalmist.  And, I say we all
need to continually affirm God's power to protect us.  Today I have created
a litany which affirms our faith in God's power, so that we need never be
afraid.  Since our current situation strikes fear in our hearts, read this
litany of courage and praise.  You need never be afraid!

	When I am being tested beyond measure in my job responsibilities ...
		I will put my trust in God.
	When I am facing the greatest hurdles of my life...
		The Lord gives me courage!
	When I feel like I am completely alone...
		The Lord is my light and salvation!
	When I feel like the bottom is falling out...
		My heart shall know no fear!  God will save me!
	When I have no other answers or solutions...
		God will send the help I need!
	When I go through every terrifying minute of the day...
		I am expecting the Lord to rescue me!
	When I think failure is upon me...
		I am brave, for God's power is greater than any situation I could possibly
face today.


"FEAR NOT, FOR I HAVE REDEEMED YOU; I HAVE CALLED YOU BY YOUR NAME, KEN AND
BEAU, YOU ARE MINE.  WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE WATERS AND GREAT TROUBLE I WILL
BE WITH YOU.  WHEN YOU GO THROUGH RIVERS, THEY SHALL NOT OVERFLOW YOU.  WHEN
YOU WALK THROUGH THE FIRE YOU SHALL NOT BE BURNED, NOR THE FLAME SCORCH YOU.
FOR I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD, YOUR SAVIOR...YOU ARE PRECIOUS IN MY SIGHT, YOU
HAVE BEEN HONORED, AND I HAVE LOVED YOU.  FEAR NOT, FOR I AM WITH YOU."
Isaiah 43:1-5

The bottom line of our life should be faith, not fear, so live today
controlled by God-inspired positive thoughts!!!

Love and prayers,
Your Hon

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

             Eli Lilly and Company Launches Lillydiabetes.com
          New Web Site Designed To Help Patients Manage Diabetes

 Lillydiabetes.com is valuable resource for the 16 million Americans with
                                 diabetes


Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) has launched lillydiabetes.com (

http://www.lillydiabetes.com), an interactive Web site designed to help the

16 million Americans with diabetes and their families understand and manage

the disease and its complications.  The Web site provides patients

information about diabetes and gives them tools to help manage their

disease.



"Diabetes is a progressive, potentially debilitating disease that requires

regular monitoring of blood sugar, blood pressure and weight, among other

things," said Doug Rude, e-commerce team leader, Eli Lilly and Company.

"Lillydiabetes.com can help empower patients and their families with the

information and tools necessary to manage their disease and live healthier

lives."



Lillydiabetes.com has a number of features and tools to encourage

aggressive management of diabetes.  Because diabetes is a chronic,

progressive disease, it is important that patients closely track their

progress toward better blood-sugar control, as well as the development of

diabetes-related complications. Those who register with the site have

access

to customizable "Measures of Control" tools designed to help patients

monitor their diabetes and the complications that can arise.  The Measures

of Control tools include:



?    HbA1c Chart (blood-sugar control) ? Hemoglobin A1c test measures
average blood-sugar levels over a two to three-month period.  Each time an
HbA1c test is done, patients can enter the value and save it as a color
graph, which then can be used to track the patient's progress toward better
blood-sugar control.
?    Height and Weight Index ? Excess body fat can lead to insulin
resistance, a major factor in the development of type 2 diabetes.  This
tool helps patients calculate their body mass index, which is a measure of
body weight relative to height.  The Web site then provides a place to save
that information and chart progress toward desired weight.


?    Blood Pressure Chart ? A common complication of diabetes is high blood
pressure, which can lead to heart disease as well as signal other
potentially serious problems, such as diabetic kidney disease.  This tool
allows patients to enter their blood pressure levels, save them and chart
their progress.


Other resources found on lillydiabetes.com include:



Product Information ? With more than 75 years of innovation in diabetes

care, Eli Lilly and Company has developed many products for the treatment

of diabetes.  This section informs users about treatment options and the

latest breakthroughs.



Lilly Diabetes Today?  Newsletter ? Users can request to receive by e-mail

this newsletter, which provides information about the latest diabetes

developments and research, as well as recipe ideas and inspiring articles.



Patient Check List ? This section provides patients and family members with

a list of issues that should be addressed by their doctor, enabling them to

work with their physician to aggressively manage their disease.



Educational Resources ? Lillydiabetes.com provides information on an array

of diabetes-related topics.  Subject headings include:  About Diabetes,

Diabetes Management, Planning Meals, Diabetes Resources, and Diabetes

Products.



Lilly plans to add new tools and features to the site every 90 days.  The

new features will help equip patients, physicians and other health care

professionals with online tools that improve understanding of the disease

and delivery of care to patients.





Eli Lilly and Company

Lilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing

portfolio of best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest

research from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with

eminent scientific organizations. Headquartered in Indianapolis, Ind.,

Lilly provides answers ? through medicines and information ? for some of

the world's most urgent medical needs.

 Study Shows Efficacy of Zyprexa Superior to Valproate in the Treatment of
               Acute Mania Associated with Bipolar Disorder
          Study is the largest comparison of two mood stabilizers


Zyprexac (olanzapine, Lilly) provides better control of manic symptoms

during treatment of acute manic or mixed manic episodes compared with

valproate (Depakotec, Abbott), according to new data presented today at the

13th European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Congress (ECNP) in Munich.

The study is the first head-to-head comparison of Zyprexa and valproate

since the FDA's approval of the use of Zyprexa for bipolar mania in March.



Key Findings

Dosing was based on both drugs' package inserts (see Study Design for more

information). The study's primary efficacy measure was the Young-Mania

Rating Scale (Y-MRS), an 11-item scale used to assess the severity of a

patient's mania. Key study endpoint findings included:



?    The Zyprexa group experienced a significantly greater improvement on
the Y-MRS total score than did patients treated with valproate (49% vs.
38%).
?    A greater proportion of Zyprexa patients achieved remission from manic
symptoms (defined as Y-MRS Total Score < 12) compared with valproate
patients (47% vs. 34%).
?    54% of patients on Zyprexa experienced a 50% or more improvement in
Y?MRS scores compared with 42% of the valproate patients.
?    Zyprexa patients demonstrated a statistically significant improvement
in certain Y-MRS Individual Item Scores compared with valproate patients:
activity/energy (53% vs. 41%), sleep (69% vs. 45%) and language-thought
disorder (49% vs. 35%).  Changes in other core symptoms of mania as defined
by the Y-MRS Individual Item Scores were similar for the two treatment
groups.




Study Design

The three-week, randomized, parallel, double-blind, acute-phase study

examined 251 hospitalized patients at 44 sites who met the DSM-IV criteria

for a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and were experiencing acute manic or

mixed episodes. Subjects received olanzapine in a flexible dose range of 5

to 20 mg/day (once daily) or valproate in a flexible does range of 500 to

2,500  mg/day (multiple doses per day). The mean ending dose for Zyprexa

was 17 mg/day and the mean ending dose for valproate was 1500 mg/day. In

addition, plasma levels were monitored to ensure valproate trough levels

were maintained within the targeted therapeutic range of 50-125 ?g/mL; the

mean value of all levels obtained was 79.4 ?g/mL. Clinicians determined

dosing based on each patient's clinical response as well as the blood

levels in patients taking valproate. Lorazepam use was restricted to a

maximum dose of 2 mg/day, and administration was prohibited within eight

hours of a psychiatric exam.



Additional Study Results

Neither Zyprexa nor valproate induced depressive symptoms in bipolar manic

or mixed patients.  In fact, both Zyprexa and valproate patients showed an

improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression

Rating Scale (HAMD-21).  However, Zyprexa patients showed greater

improvement at the study endpoint in HAMD-21 scores (35% vs. 24%).  The

effects of Zyprexa have not yet been studied in bipolar depression.



Zyprexa was generally well tolerated. The most common and significantly

different adverse events for Zyprexa were somnolence (39.2% vs. 20.6% for

valproate), dry mouth (33.6% vs. 6.3%), and increased appetite (12.0% vs.

2.4%).  The most common adverse event for valproate was nausea (28.6% vs.

10.4% for Zyprexa). Additional safety information for Zyprexa and valproate

can be obtained from their package inserts.



"These data support the value of Zyprexa as a much needed treatment

option," said Mauricio Tohen, M.D., Dr. P.H., medical adviser, Lilly

Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, and lead investigator for the

study.  "The findings provide further evidence that Zyprexa effectively

stabilizes mood in patients with bipolar disorder."



Manic symptoms occur during the manic phase of bipolar disorder, a lifelong

illness characterized by disruptive swings in mood.  Symptoms include

abnormal elation and/or irritability, often accompanied by an unrealistic

belief in one's own abilities, increased sex drive, delusions and alcohol

or drug abuse.  People with bipolar disorder also may experience mixed

episodes, marked by symptoms of mania and clinical depression occurring

simultaneously. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,

Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).  American Psychiatric Association, 1994.


Zyprexa (olanzapine, Lilly)
valproate (Depakote, Abbott)


The study findings are particularly pertinent in light of valproate's

recent revised black box warning from the Food and Drug Administration

following reports of life-threatening pancreatitis in both children and

adults.



"Physicians have good reason to take these new data into account," said

Carlos A. Zarate, M.D., associate professor of psychiatry and director,

bipolar and psychotic disorders program, University of Massachusetts

Medical Center.  "The efficacy of Zyprexa coupled with its favorable safety

profile suggest that it may provide a timely treatment alternative for

patients with bipolar disorder."



Zyprexa is indicated in the United States for the management of the

manifestations of psychotic disorders as demonstrated in short-term

clinical trials with schizophrenia patients.  It is also approved for the

short-term treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar

disorder.



In the original schizophrenia registration trials, olanzapine was generally

well tolerated.  However, as with all medications, olanzapine was

associated with some side effects.  In the original six-week, acute-phase

schizophrenia trials, the most common treatment-emergent adverse event

associated with olanzapine was somnolence.  Other common events were

dizziness, weight gain, constipation, akathisia (restlessness), and

postural hypotension.  Modest elevations of prolactin were also seen,

although mean changes from baseline to endpoint were not statistically

significantly different between olanzapine and placebo.  A small number of

patients experienced asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminase; none

of these patients developed jaundice or drug-induced hepatitis.



In short-term (three- and four-week) acute bipolar mania trials, the most

common treatment-emergent adverse event associated with olanzapine was

somnolence.  Other common events were dry mouth, dizziness, asthenia,

constipation, dyspepsia, increased appetite, and tremor.

portfolio of best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest

     RPI TO INITIATE PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS ON ANTI-HEPATITIS C DRUG

BOULDER,  Colorado  -  September  28,  2000: Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(RPI)  (NASDAQ:RZYM)  today announced that it has repurchased its rights to
Heptazyme?  from  Eli Lilly and Company and will initiate Phase II clinical
trials  as  soon  as  possible  for  the Anti-Hepatitis C ribozyme to study
dose-ranging  and  biological  markers  of  the  drug's efficacy in chronic
Hepatitis C patients.

Earlier  this month, RPI and Eli Lilly and Company completed a 28 day study
of Heptazyme (LY466700) following daily subcutaneous injections that showed
successful  safety,  tolerability  and pharmacokinetics.  The next phase of
clinical trials will examine the safety and efficacy of Heptazyme alone, at
higher  doses  than  used  in  previous  studies,  and  in combination with
interferon,  a  current  treatment  for  patients  with  Hepatitis C  virus
infection.

Lilly has directed the clinical trials for the Anti-Hepatitis C ribozyme to
date   under   a   licensing   agreement  between  the  parties.   Ribozyme
Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.  has now renegotiated the global rights to Heptazyme
and  will  direct  all  subsequent  clinical trials.  The Phase II trial is
expected to begin in the first quarter of 2001.

"We  are  pleased  to  be  able  to repurchase Heptazyme rights and to have
resources  to  develop  it aggressively," said Ralph E. Christoffersen, CEO
and  President  of RPI.  "We are committed to address the need for improved
therapies  for  HCV,  and  plan  to  move forward as quickly as feasible in
Heptazyme's development."

Ribozymes   are  the  product  of  Nobel  Prize  winning  science  and  are
synthetically engineered to act as "molecular scissors" capable of cleaving
target RNA in a highly specific manner.

RPI (www.rpi.com), located in Boulder, Colorado, is the acknowledged leader
in ribozyme therapeutic development.  RPI has recently announced a ribozyme
commercial  development  program  to develop a ribozyme therapeutic against
Hepatitis  B.  RPI is partnered with Chiron Corporation for the development
and  commercialization  of ANGIOZYME?, an anti-angiogenic ribozyme designed
to  inhibit  the  growth  of new blood supplies to tumors and prevent tumor
growth  and  metastasis.   ANGIOZYME  is  in  Phase I/II clinical trials in
cancer  patients  at  the  Cleveland Clinic.  RPI is also partnered with an
affiliate  of Elan Corporation plc for development and commercialization of
HERZYME?, an anti-HER-2 ribozyme for treatment of breast and other cancers,
through RPI's subsidiary Medizyme Pharmaceuticals Ltd.

RPI  will  have  a Live Webcast regarding this information today at 3:00 pm
MDT.  This webcast can be accessed through the RPI website (www.rpi.com) in
the Investor Relations section.

-   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
-   exchange fund transactions

We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two
reasons:

   There are certain times when you should not engage in market
   transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these "black-outs" occur around
   the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
   announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of "inside
   information" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our
   reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.
   While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to
   you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have
   legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.

2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.

If you had any Lilly stock transactions in September, please advise me as
soon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature
and file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").  The
reports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day
of the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am
not available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any
proposed transaction.

If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate
to call me.  Thank you for your cooperation.

To GOP Activists
Fr Ken Hutcheson
Re George W. Bush Debate Win/Al Gore's Lies

I hope you got a chance to see the debate last night.  George W. Bush did a
very good job articulating his message and debating Al Gore.

I am sure it will come as no surprise to you that Al Gore could not go the
entire debate without telling a lie.  In fact, two lies have been exposed so
far.

The first one was Gore's claim that he visited Texas with FEMA Director,
James Lee Witt, after the bad Texas floods and tornadoes.  As it turns out,
that was a lie.  Al Gore on the morning news shows today claimed that he
thought he had, but it must have been another state.  Go figure.

The next lie exposed is as follows:

News radio 970 WFLA interviewed the principal of Sarasota High this morning.
He said that the girl that Gore was talking about had no desk for exactly
one day.  It was the first day of class and they were still making
adjustments to the kids class schedule and that particular classroom was
being refurbished.  The teacher only had to call the office and get her a
desk because they have plenty of desks there.  Apparently there is a picture
that was sent to Gore of her standing in class or something like that
because the Principal mentions that in the picture of her there is $100,000
of new equipment behind her.

Please pass this along to your friends and family and any undecided voters.
The more people who realize that Al Gore is a pathological liar, the better
George W. Bush will do.

Please check out the two links and cast your vote for George W. Bush as the
winner in last night's debate:  http://news.excite.com/news/poll/ or
http://www.cnn.com/

Last but not least....Have you done everything you can do to elect George W.
Bush?  Have you made a small contribution to Victory 2000?  Have you
participated in a literature drop for the GOP Ticket or made phone calls on
its behalf?  If not, please let me know.

Thanks for your support.

Mr. Chairman,
?
Archer's ex son in law is contacting him to see if  he do a spot similar to 
what the President did for us in 1996. We can cut the  spot at Archer's 
convenience and he will have total script approval,  obviously.
?
I am preparing a poll memorandum showing that this  will not kill him with 
Republicans, especially younger Republicans, so he has  nothing to fear.
?
I will also send him a copy of the President's spot  from '96.
?
I understand that Jordan is trying to contact  Archer also.
?
Anything that you could do to encourage Archer to  consider this will be of 
great help. We didn't poll on Archer...but I know his  support will have a 
tremendous impact on the Westside and we need  that.
?

Attached file is a memo from our pollster on  Republicans should you talk to 
Bill  Archer.

?

Channel 2 did a poll story on Thursday  which shows the Arena with a 19 or 20 
point lead. It was their poll. Our  latest show about the same.

Dad,
We are not going to go to D.C. on the 16th as Jose
Luis needs to be back here for meetings on the 16th.
This just came up. He would like to meet with Lynn
Coleman at some time, but it may neet to wait until
later this month (depending on how things go this
Friday).
I hope you guys had a good time in Palm Beach. Houston
is FREEZING! Now we have perfect weather in Florida,
though with hight of only 78!
I'll see you this weekend.
Love,
Elizabeth

COLLEEN PARKER

 - SLIL-Elanco Agreement.doc
The Chronicle is developing a front page story  based on a Garnett Coleman 
idea to change state law to allow Sports Authority  tax funds to go to fund 
public hospitals.
?
It is my judgement that this story and the spin  afterwards could easily 
shave 10 points off our yes #'s and make this a  horserace again.
?
It is even worse than the stealth tax increase in  '96 because it cuts to the 
heart of voters' objections to the funding of sports  facilities. And it 
takes away our reponse that this money cannot legally ever be  used to fund 
hospitals or education. This was the basis of their successful  attack in 
'99---only this time we don't have any real response.
?
The Chronicle has delayed this story for  one day.
?
I won't waste your time reviewing the various  things we have done to spin 
this better. We have done many things. But it is  like putting bandaids on a 
gaping chest wound.
?
Could you call Jack Loftis or Sweeney at  the Chronicle? We need to downplay 
it or kill it. I have more info if you want to  talk---713-851-2576.

There will be news on this subject soon that could  make the Rockets payments 
to the city look very paltry without some good spin.  Since you did the Enron 
Deal, I wanted to give you a heads up and some talking  points which I will 
have for you Monday. I think the news will keep until  then.

THERE WILL NOT BE AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEETING ON MONDAY, OCTOBER 30
Rep. Archer did a great job today filming the spot.  Fyi, we will put it up 
on Thursday and hold a news conference that same day with  four Republican 
state reps and preview the spot for TV and the  chronicle.
?
Would you send Archer a short note thanking  him, Sharon and Don Carlson, his 
aide, for their excellent  effort?
?
Thanks. Everything is good. Our four day tracking  poll (we are tracking 
every night except friday and saturday) shows us  up 59-34. Give the 
opponents all the undecided and we are still in  shape to coast in 55-45--a 
20 point turnaround from  '99.
Sue asked me to send following  information:
?
Sylvia will hold a news conference on Tuesday to  endorse the arena. The 
press advisory sent out today will cause many of them to  think she is going 
to oppose the arena. That's good because more of the media  will show up.
?
Her basic statement will be to reinforce her  position, as the city's fiscal 
watchdog, that this will not take one dime away  from basic services and will 
indeed help the city keep growing and thus have  more funding for city 
services---especially the $13 million a  year that the Arena will generate in 
sales taxes and the increase in property  values downtown.
?
It will be great if Mr. Lay could show up at the  event and that Sylvia for 
her support and objective analysis of the arena  benefits.
Flash.
?
Hotze just bought TV. Looks like 125k total  for one week. Not certain. 
Cannot tell about complete buy since it isn't in the  public file.
?
Spot will run on 11 at 5,6, 10 news and  some on Letterman. 
?
Will consider response if spot seems to be  good. Tracking polls will follow.
?
I am putting Archer on Thursday ahead of  schedule to counter.
?
Will  advise.
Here is the text of their spot. Attn: PSI, dub will  arrive tomorrow.
here is the attachment.

Here what they have actually bought:

22,995    13
  9,100    2
  6,900    26
62,695    Total.

They've told the stations that they expect to add time to the buy. But that
will be very difficult for them to do next week and it will not be all that
much any way.

The Carson "Group" is a one man operation out of a cat ridden house
somewhere out west.

Our in-house media guy says the TV is being placed by the Carson Group. The
Tv stations have said they will not tell us how much has been spent on the
buy over the phone, but they will show us in person if we send someone to
the stations. Have you found out any more information?

Subject: rockets season has begun


Hello dear siblings... yes, believe it or not, I  am sending one of my rare 
e-mails.?
?
I will be in charge of distributing Rocket  tickets this season for mom and 
Ken?since I successfully accomplished  baseball ticket distribution without 
having a nervous breakdown.? You all  were actually wonderful and made it 
very easy due to the rules that were set  up by the folks prior to my 
receiving that responsibility.? Organization  comes natural to me so I am 
happy to do it again so that mom has one less  thing on her plate.
?
Rules have not yet been sent out by mom and  Ken,?but I do want to get a jump 
start on the season distribution since  it is upon us already.? With 
baseball, all ticket were requested prior to  the 1st of each month, so that 
I was able to commit game tickets to family and  then to Mom and Ken's 
significant other people for that  given?month.? Tickets were requested and 
guaranteed one  month?at a time?not further out?than that.? There was also  
some sort of first come first serve rule?which I don't fully remember but  it 
also never became a problem.??All of these rules made it  work?so I suggest 
sticking to them  again?regarding?basketball.??(Mom and Ken?may null  and 
void all of this with new rules but these are my suggestions until they do  
so.)
?
There are 4 tickets grouped together on row 1 and  an additional 4 tickets 
grouped together on row 2.? So, this year we have  the pleasure of an 
additional 4 tickets at each game which should make the  rubics cube of 
ticket distribution a bit easier.
?
November games include:
?
Thursday??? ???  Nov.2?????? ?? 7:30  pm??? Milwaukee
Tuesday??? ???  ?Nov.7???????? 7:30  pm??? Los Angeles
Thursday??? ???  Nov.9?????? ?? 7:30  pm??? Vancover
Tuesday????  ??? Nov.14????????7:30  pm????Chicago
Thursday??????  Nov.16??? ??? 7:30 pm???  Charlotte
Saturday??? ???  Nov.18??? ??? 7:30 pm???  Pheonix
Tuesday??????  ? Nov. 28???????7:30  pm??? Sacramento
?
Please let me know ASAP what your requests are  for the month of November and 
I will do my best to try and make everyone  happy.? This needs to be resolved 
by friday of this week  Nov.3rd so that I am able to distribute to family and 
then start  making calls down the list of mom and Ken's significant other 
people so that  all tickets are used.? If you have not contacted me by friday 
with your  requests, I will distribute tickets so no whining is allowed if 
you don't get  what you later realize you want.? Remember FRIDAY IS THE 
DEADLINE FOR THE  MONTH OF NOVEMBER.
?
Regarding December, get your requests in now  which will be final and tickets 
will be distributed to everyone by  friday the?1st of December.
No tickets will go unused.
?
December games include:
?
Saturday??? ??? Dec  2??????????7:30  pm??? Portland

Best way to get me is by fax 713 629  5755 since I am at home with the wee 
precious ones.? I receive  faxes?instantly.? For those of you that are hipper 
than me and like  email, that is another option but?it takes a maximum?of 24 
hours for  me to receive your messages since Christophe takes the computer to

The ch 2 survey had a wider spread but I don't  think it is accurate (63-36).

The Chronicle will be calling tomorrow with their  poll numbers. Their poll 
is a creation of Dick Murray and Bob Stein. I would  expect them to show us 
in a much tighter race. These guys are not always  accurate (remember their 
60-40 against poll on baseball in '96).

Attached for your information is the letter to shareholders that Sidney
mentioned at the October board meeting.  If you have any questions, please
call me.

Alecia DeCoudreaux


(See attached file: ST Election Letter.pdf)


 - ST Election Letter.pdf
This is a reminder of your ongoing obligation to report to the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") transactions in Lilly stock.  In light of
the complexity of the reporting rules and the potential for severe
penalties for noncompliance, please contact me in advance of any
transaction.  As a reminder, the SEC rules cover all transactions,
including:

-   purchases
-   sales
-   gifts
-   trust or partnership transactions
-   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
-   exchange fund transactions

We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two
reasons:

   There are certain times when you should not engage in market
   transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these "black-outs" occur around
   the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
   announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of "inside
   information" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our
   reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.
   While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to
   you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have
   legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.

2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.

If you had any Lilly stock transactions in October, please advise me as
soon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature
and file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").  The
reports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day
of the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am
not available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any
proposed transaction.

If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate
to call me.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Dear Friends and Family,
We are down to the wire and the race couldn't be
closer. Every vote counts, even those of you in Texas.
Please, remember to vote and go early, polls open at
7am across the country and close at 7pm but don't put
it off until 7pm as there could be lines and the
supervisors are not required to keep the polls open
after 7pm for those in line.
Remind your friends and family to vote and if someone
needs transportation to the polls, give them a ride or
call your local Victory 2000 office (Republicans) or
your local Democratic campaign office, they will have
people available to transport people to the polls.
Keep an eye out while you are at the polls for
electoral fraud and report any suspicious activity
including inappropriate campaigning to the poll
watchers at the polls. The Democrats and the
Republicans will have representatives at most of the
polls, let them know if there is suspicious activity.
Finally, if you have time, call your local offices and
offer your time to make phone calls to encourage
people to get out and vote, pass out leaflets, or to
be available to help prevent of voter fraud.

Finally, enjoy the evening and watch the results come
in. There are election watch parties everywhere!!!

Just one more day (and no more mass political e-mail's
from me and everyone else)!
Take care and VOTE!
Liz

Dear Family,
Heather and I were talking about NYC and thought we
should make some reservations for dinner for the
entire family on Friday and Saturday night. I am
trying to get reservations for the entire family at Le
Cirque 2000 for Friday night at 7:30 but we will be
very lucky to get in. Does anyone have other
suggestions or an objection to Le Cirque? I am
attaching a review of the restaurant. It is definitely
a little "Haute" but I've heard it is also a lot of
fun. Heather is looking into Italian restaurants for
Saturday night, as well.

This is just a suggestion but we were worried that we
may have difficutly getting into a good restaurant if
we wait too long. Also, I think I am just a little
excited about the trip!
Luv to all
Liz

Peruse Le Cirque 2000's blockbuster wine list now.

Also Nominated for Best French Restaurant
Daniel, Chanterelle, Jean Georges, Le Bernardin

Also Nominated for Best Dessert
Gramercy Tavern, Payard Patisserie, Jean Georges, Park
Avenue Cafe

The Scene
Uber-designer Adam Tihany's (Jean Georges, among
others) surreal interior evokes simultaneous thoughts
of the Sistine Chapel and "The Jetsons." Purple,
one-armed velvet chairs, neon tubing and
stainless-steel sculptures compete for attention with
the soaring, gilded ceilings, pre-Raphaelite murals
and bejeweled patrons. Ringleader Sirio Maccioni
oversees a front-of-house that has won praise for
softening the haughty edge that marked the
restaurant's pre-Y2K incarnation.

The Food
Still some of the most sublime haute cuisine around.
Though longtime sous chef Sotta Kuhnn is now heading
the kitchen=01*having succeeded Sylvain Portay (who took
over for Daniel Boulud)=01*the luxurious,
truffle-and-foie-gras-studded fare remains as sharp as
ever. The current menu includes the long-running
paupiette of sea bass with Barolo sauce and leeks, as
well a sauteed veal chop with bacon-wrapped asparagus.
Patrons can take decision-making out of the picture
entirely with the five-course chef's degustation menu,
a bargain at $90.

We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two
reasons:

   There are certain times when you should not engage in market
   transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these "black-outs" occur around
   the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
   announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of "inside
   information" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our
   reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.
   While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to
   you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have
   legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.

2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.

If you had any Lilly stock transactions in November, please advise me as
soon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature
and file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").  The
reports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day
of the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am
not available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any
proposed transaction.

If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate
to call me.  Thank you for your cooperation.

                Lilly and Generex Sign Agreement To Develop

                          Buccal Form of Insulin



Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Generex Biotechnology Corporation

(NASDAQ: GNBT) today announced that they have signed an agreement to

develop a buccal formulation of insulin that is administered as a fine

spray into the oral cavity using Generex proprietary technology.



Under the terms of the agreement, Generex will receive certain initial fees

and milestone payments.  Generex will also receive royalty payments based

on product sales.  In exchange, Lilly will receive exclusive worldwide

rights to products resulting from the collaboration.  Lilly will be

responsible for conducting clinical trials, securing regulatory approvals

and marketing on a worldwide basis.  Clinical trials of the first product

candidate are under way in North America and Europe.  Lilly will also have

the option to develop a number of additional products depending on the

success of the initial product.



"We look forward to working with Generex, whose buccal spray delivery

technology potentially represents a novel approach to drug delivery," said

James A. Harper, president, diabetes and growth disorders products for

Lilly. "A buccal spray formulation of insulin could provide an attractive

alternative for people with diabetes."



"The opportunity to partner with Lilly, the global leader in insulins, to

develop the world's first marketed buccal insulin spray represents very

good news for millions of patients with diabetes throughout the world,"

said Anna Gluskin, chief executive officer of Generex. "We are pleased that

Lilly has recognized the potential of buccal delivery of insulin and

Generex's RapidMist? technology for systemic delivery of proteins, peptides

and other large molecule drugs."



Today, worldwide costs for treating diabetes and its complications are

estimated to exceed $200 billion annually.  It is also estimated that, over

the next decade, the number of people with this disease will more than

double.  Lilly has been a leader in diabetes care for more than 75 years.

The company continues to aggressively pursue the goal of being a complete

diabetes care company and intends to provide innovative products to treat

all types and stages of diabetes.



Generex is engaged in the research and development of drug delivery systems

and technologies. To date, it has focused on developing a platform

technology for the buccal delivery (absorption through the inner cheek

walls) of large molecule drugs which, historically, have been administered

only by injection. Additional information about Generex can be found at

www.generex.com.



Lilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing

portfolio of best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest

research from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with

eminent scientific organizations. Headquartered in Indianapolis, Ind.,

Lilly provides answers ? through medicines and information ? for some of

the world's most urgent medical needs.



Certain statements set forth above may constitute forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. Although Generex and Lilly believe that such statements are
based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of their knowledge of
their business and operations, there can be no assurance that: (i) Lilly or
Generex will not terminate the collaboration, (ii) that any products will
be developed, manufactured or commercialized successfully, or (iii) that
significant funding will be received by Generex as a result of this
collaboration.

Each company's business is subject to significant risks and there can be no
assurance that actual results of the companies' development activities and
results of their operations will not differ materially from expectations.
For information with respect to other factors, which could cause actual
results to differ from expectations, reference is made to the 10-K and 10-Q
reports filed by Generex and Lilly, respectively, with the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Hi Liz -

I had a very interesting conversation with Rocky.  He is still in business, 
just finishing up boots for the new President.    Also, I have been called 
"Precious" and "Baby" this morning.  Somehow, it just seems appropriate from 
him!!

He is located at RJ's Boot Company and Shoe Shop
3321 Ella Blvd. & 34th Street
Houston, Texas  77018

Phone:  713-682-1650, fax 713-682-5520

Linda, before we knew that you and Ken were going to the VIP reception, Ken 
had me ask if others could attend in your place.  I did ask and they have 
just called me that Nancy Kinder said that it is o.k. for the Vermeils and 
the Herrolds to attend, in addition to you and Ken.  They did ask if we would 
not spread it around as others have asked and they have not let them.

Oh, but Beau just called that Heather is ill and they are cancelling.  

Rosie
On Tuesday, July 25, I am meeting with Molecular Electronics Corp. (MEC) to 
discuss the opportunity for establishing this newly formed company in 
Houston.  For those of you that are not familiar with MEC, they are 
considered one of the premier companies in the area of molecular computing.  
MEC has approached Enron to discuss a possible alliance that would facilitate 
their development and, in particular, location in the Houston area.  MEC 
represents the frontier of computing technology.

I would like to invite you to participate in a working lunch discussion of 
the opportunities and obstacles facing a company that is seeking to change an 
industry.  I would appreciate it if you could join us on July 25  from 11:30 
to 1:30 in EB49C1 for this informal roundtable with the CEO of MEC, Harvey 
Plotnick and one of the founders, Jim Tour.

Will you please let Vanessa Groscrand know if you can attend at 713-853-1769 
or please reply by e-mail to me.

Hi Donna -

Ken said that the letter is fine.  Do you want to send us a list of the past 
Fathers and let us send the letters?

Let me know.

Subject: Solicitation to Past Fathers of the Year


Ken,
  Thank you so very much for thinking of this idea.  It is so timely and
certainly fits with Kirbyjon's challenge. I have spoken with Hardie (who
also edited this letter for me) and we both agree that this would have much
greater impact if it came directly from you, as a past Father of the Year.
As you can see we attributed the information about our shortfall directly
to me, so I am involved in the letter but not doing the solicitation.  If
you are not comfortable with this, just let me know and I will redo the
letter.  I think if you agree to send this out over your signature it would
be enormously helpful.  Please let me know what you'd like me to do.

  Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and continuous support.

As we discussed, the date that Ken thinks is best for the United Way Kick-off 
is August 9 at the conclusion of the Employee Meeting.  He thinks it would be 
fine to do the presentations there and then move on to whatever activity is

Hello Janice:

 I enjoyed your recent e-mail but was sorry to hear about your dad.  It 
sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly.  These are always 
difficult times.  As I watched my mother and father's health deteriorate and 
ultimately watched them die, it is a very defining time in our lives.  But we 
can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege 
to have been raised in such loving homes.

 Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU.  He is joining an 
excellent company.  I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his 
education working toward an MBA.  As we are living in an age where 
intellectual capital is so valuable, it is important for every young person 
to obtain the very best possible education they can.  As to our family, 
within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a 
young man from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They met while they were both 
working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires.  They're currently on their 
honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to 
Miami, Florida.  This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born.  It 
was born to our son David and his wife Courtney.  It was a 7 lb., 10 oz.,  20 
inch little boy.  So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters 
ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days.  They are a great 
deal of fun.  We are doing quite well.  I am looking forward to seeing Ginger 
"Rees" Copeland when she comes to Houston.  I would be delighted to arrange 
tickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit 
Houston.

 I hope you have a great summer.
Thank you for your recent request for Mr. Lay to speak at your conference.  
Unfortunately, do to Mr. Lay's schedule he will not be able to participate.

Thank you again,

Tori L. Wells
Executive Secretary
Hi -

Subject: Meeting with Arthur Levitt in September


 Dear Ken,

 As you know, our next meeting is on Wednesday, July 12 from
3:00-5:30 p.m.  In the next week or so, we'll be sending around a discussion
paper which we hope crystallizes the issues, and we will try to talk to as
many of you as possible before the meeting to go through it.

 Meanwhile, Arthur Levitt has agreed to meet with us in September to
brainstorm on the ideas we've generated and also to give us a sense of some
of the issues as he sees them.  There are three possible dates for the
meeting, which I suggest be in two parts -- first, a meeting among the panel
only from 5:00-6:30 p.m., and then a dinner with Chairman Levitt from
6:30-8:30 p.m.  Here are the dates:

 Could you please let us know which of these would be possible for
you:


  ___________ Thursday, September 14  5:00-8:30 pm

  ___________ Monday, September 25  5:00-8:30 pm

  ___________ Wednesday, September 27 5:00-8:30 pm



 Many thanks,
 Jeff Garten

RE:??? June 14 Reception 

Recently Charles Miller and David Dewhurst sent you an invitation 
to a reception which they are hosting on Wed. 6/14 at 5:00 PM to be 
held at the Houston Petroleum Club. 

I hope that you will be able to attend that event. 

Under the leadership of Governor Bush and others we have made real progress 
in Education in Texas over the past decade.? Now it is time to take 
the next steps and achieve even greater progress in our public education 
system. 

The Texas Education Reform Caucus is made up of business leaders, educators, 
and elected officials dedicated to finding common sense approaches to 
improving 
education in Texas. 

I would appreciate the opportunity to visit with you on the 14th.

Dear Dr. Lay,
        In my last note, I believe I promised to check on the dates for the
Faculty-Alumni Awards ceremonies in the future.  The University and the MU
Alumni Association have them scheduled for:
        October 26, 2001,
        October 4, 2002, and
        October 10, 2003.
As I mentioned, the nominations are due February 1st of each year, and
attendance at the awards ceremony is necessary in order to receive it.  The
process is competitive, but I would like to proceed with your nomination
this coming winter if the 2001 date is available on your schedule.
        I visited with Mr. Purdy yesterday about a project at the Evans
Scholars House.  He and Mrs. Purdy seem to be doing fine - and enjoying the
spring sunshine!
        I look forward to visiting with you again.  Until then, I am

p.s.  hope you have a relaxing holiday weekend!

Dear Rosalee,

The Council meeting in Geneva will take place on 31 August-1 September. As
is a tradition, it will start with a dinner on Thursday 31 August and end

Dear Governing Board member,

This is just let you know that three of our Board members - Victor Menezes
(Citibank), PC Chatterjee (The Chatterjee Group), and Uday Khemka (the SUN
Group of Industries) - are co-hosting a fund-raising dinner for the ISB on
Tuesday, May 16, 2000 in New York. While I understand this is short notice,
in case you are in New York on that date and also available for dinner, we
will be delighted if you could join us. Rajat, Dean Jacobs, and a number of
other Board members and supporters will also be there.

Please block off the date on your calendar and let me know if it is
possible for you to attend. We will be sending out a formal invitation in a
few days. Also, do let us know if you have any suggestions on who we should
invite for the event.

Please also note that the next meeting of the ISB Governing Board will be
held in New York on Thursday, September 28 from about noon to 6PM.

With best regards,

Mike has suggested that we cut back  board meetings to fewer than the eight 
(8) we currently hold.? In order to  give you some background, Linda checked 
other peer companies and the meetings  range from 6 to 8 a year.? 
?
I think that we can cut back to 6,  however it may be more prudent to drop to 
7 this year and first see how it goes  .? The two meetings that can be 
dropped most easily are June or  September.? 
?
June,  because we have the two day strat  plan meeting in July, and Sept. 
because we don't yet have 4th quarter results  and not a lot of new 
information is available.
?
I think that the board meetings take up   an incredible amount of Compaq 
executive time and energy. I would rather have  them concentrate on getting 6 
or 7 meetings right, getting the company back on  track and? increasing 
earnings.? So, my vote is to?recommend to the board that we  eliminate the 
September '01 meeting.? That is a particularly busy month for  many people as 
exhibited by the lack of attendance we had at this past September  meeting (5 
members).? In looking back, we seem to be able to "fill the  house" in June.
?
On the other hand, you all may want to  continue with the number of meetings 
we currently have.? I will await your  reply.

Subject: Cougars @ Enron

Ken,
Thank you for the opportunity to meet today at the "Enron Teaching Excellence 
Awards."  It was an indeed an honor and a privilege to finally speak to you 
in person.  Ironically, when I returned to the office today I received your 
interoffice mail concerning the below email.  I certainly understand that you 
will not be able to attend many events as I am sure that your schedule is 
quite demanding.  I believe that this group will benefit substantially by 
knowing that you are aware that it exists and want to support it.  Is it 
possible to send a brief email to UH alumni at Enron letting them know as 
such?  If the alumni see that you support our efforts, they will take an 
increased interest in participating and provide us a solid foundation with 
which to work.  Please provide me any feedback you may have.

As we talked about today, we would like to begin having occasional "brown 
bags" in an effort to get the alumni better acquainted with the university.  
I believe that we should have one with Dr. Smith to promote the image 
campaign, changes at the university, the tier 1 status, etc.  If you could 
make it that would be great but if not that is OK as well.  I will send you 
the date when I have it.

Chet Gladchuk has agreed to work with us to orchestrate a tailgate party on 
Sept. 16th to welcome Dana Dimel in his first home football game.  We will 
have a tent, food, refreshments, football tickets, etc.  I suspect that it 
will be from approx. 4:00 PM to 10:00 PM.  Please let me know if your 
calendar is free.

I am truly excited to have you as alumni and am grateful for your 
approachability.  Please let me stress that I do not expect you to make all 
or even most of our events.  I would just like to let you know what we are 
doing and if you find that you are free, we would love to have you.

Thank you for your time,
Jeff

To: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON

Subject: Cougars @ Enron

Mr. Lay,
My name is Jeff McClellan and I am President of the "Cougars @ Enron".  We 
are a group of Enron employees that are UH alumni that have banded together 
to form a chartered extension of the Houston Alumni Organization.  We had our 
kickoff event in the 50th floor dining room on March 7th of this year and 
have received substantial interest in our organization.  I wanted to drop you 
a line to tell you not only about us, but also what we are doing.  As of 
today, we have 107 employees that have expressed interest in contributing to 
our group's success. We have several stated objectives:

1. Network Enron Cougars together to build strong working relationships.  
This will benefit the employees as well as the company.
2. Raise and present scholarships to Enron dependents to attend the 
University of Houston.  This will help to ease education costs.
3. Assist the company in its recruiting efforts concerning the university.
4. Assist the university through financial gifts whenever possible.

Currently, here is what we have planned:

4/15/2000 The HAO has given us their hall at "Frontier Fiesta".   Frontier 
Fiesta is a festival thrown by the students and alumni that provides good 
family   fun. The HAO is having it catered and everyone is invited.

9/16/2000 We are throwing a tailgate party to celebrate Dana Dimel's first 
home football game against Army.  We are working with Chet Gladchuk to set up 
a   tent, have it catered, listen to a live band, football tickets, etc.  We 
would like to make this event open to all of Enron if possible.  The 
university will   provide Enron special recognition on both the Cougar Vision 
Scoreboard and over the PA in both the first and second half of the contest.

These are the confirmed events so far as we are still in the opening stages.  
We anticipate to have more events planned (golf tournament) which I would 
like the opportunity to share with you.  This group is designed to cater to 
its members, the company, and the university and I believe it is going to be 
one of the most successful out there.  To achieve such a plateau, however, we 
need to be a continuous draw to old and new alumni alike.  To have you as an 
alumni is truly a monumental draw to our employees and the university.  Would 
you consider making several appearances with us at our events?  Your 
participation would greatly increase our exposure and ability to accomplish 
our goals and we would love the chance to honor you as one of our most 
distinguished alumni.  If there are any suggestions that you may have as to 
how to further our group, I would love to hear them.  I understand that you 
are extremely busy and I do not wish to monopolize your time but this alumni 
charter is something that I truly believe in and I hope you will agree that 
it has great potential.  With you support, we can attain a level of success 
that will set us aside from any other group.

Thank you for your time,
Jeff

Hi Mr. Garten and Valerie -

We have been working on Ken's schedule.  It is a fairly busy week, but it 
looks like he could do a 30 minute conference call on Wed. at 2:30 p.m. (New 
York time), if that is still good for you.  Please let me know if Wednesday 
is a satisfactory time for the phone call.  That appears to be the only 
window he has next week.

Valerie had already sent the SEC Panel Outline on 4/11, which you attached 
below.  Ken Lay has already seen it.

Re:  the other question that you asked about Ken Lay's name appearing in a 
press release, he said that is fine.

Dear Ken,

We are in the process of trying to arrange a conference call with you on
either Tuesday or Wednesday of next week to discuss the paper which is
attached.  ( I'm sending it along now so that you have some time to look at
it.)

We will be doing this by conference call and once we set a time to talk with
you, will give you the number to call.  (To set up a time, your office can
contact my assistant, Valerie Petersen either at valerie.petersen@yale.edu
or at 203-432-6035.)

Look forward to speaking with you next week.

Best regards,
Jeff Garten

Hi Liz -

Your Father wrote:

"Elizabeth -

The Republican Convention is July 31 - August 3.  Although there are no 
guarantees I expect I can get you tickets and reservations.

Love,

Dad"

Liz, I have sent an e-mail to our Washington office to ask for assistance in 
obtaining hotel reservations and credentials.  We don't yet have reservations 
for Ken as everything is locked up by the Republicans, but I have been 
assured they will be forthcoming.  We asked for the same hotel as your Dad 
will have, so hopefully that will work.

Hi Corey -

My champion, hero, angel - I think I have made a major mistake!!!  I thought 
I had tickets to Mark McGuire's team for May 12, but it is the Cinncinatti 
Reds!!!  I am so sorry.  Is that going to be o.k.?  That's  what I get for 
thinking I know anything about baseball.

Look forward to hearing from you!!

Love,

Yes, indeed.

Hi Terry -

Ken Lay said that he would really like an update and more detail about the 
"Digital Divide" and TFA.  He is attending the Fortune Battle Royal and said 
this fits right in with the subject.  He will be leaving for Washington 
tomorrow night.

Thanks.

Dear Ken:

Night before last I visited with President and Mrs. Bush and suggested that he
give you a call regarding TFA (Technology For All)! I told him that it might
prove valuable for his son's campaign!  When we spoke with Cynthia Sandherr in
Washington a week or so ago, she said that the "Digital Divide" was the 
hottest
topic on Capital Hill.  She had some wonderful ideas on how to spin this so 
that
businesses create the bridge for the divide and not government!  Although we
want to stay nonpartisan with TFA, this would be a wonderful press opportunity
and platform in Washington!

Just thought I should give you "heads-up" in case he asks and please tell 
Linda
I said hello!

Thank you for doing so much for the cause!

Subject: Jeff Skilling does MS150




	

Well, the bike is inspected, a few training rides have been made, and the 
camping gear is being dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the 
fairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, 
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff 
Skilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS.

Enron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over 
350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the 
Enron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am 
challenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain 
amount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a 
break on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's 
closer to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat 
pledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge 
to this very worthy cause 1-1.

I hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top 
money raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your 
consideration.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.

Sherri x3-5984









Ken will be there.

Sherri, I'm sorry I have been sending your e-mails to the "old" name.  I 
didn't realize it had been changed, but this is so right and very good!

Well, I know this is terribly short notice, but Ken does have a meeting with 
Tom DeLay on Monday morning at 9:30 a.m.  (I know that's half a day gone for 
Joe if he's in town), but he is coming in to discuss RMIC (Republican 
Majority Issues Committee).  Are there specific things that Ken needs to be 
briefed on?  I know that Steve did recommend that Ken have this meeting.

Thanks very much.

Rosie
Ken Lay has approved the attached expense report for Rosalee Fleming.


Ms. Grobmyer -

I have forwarded your message to Bill Donovan at Enron.  If there is any 
interest, I'm sure he will contact you.

Rebecca,  I just talked to Ken and asked him again.  He said that there had 
been a couple of developments while he was in London, so he wanted to wait 
until he gets back to the office and has a chance to talk to you.  He will be 
in the office on Thursday.

Thanks.

Mr. Platt -

Ken Lay said that he will approve the $10,000 underwriter costs to be one of 
the five sponsors for the media briefing on March 14.  Mr. Lay has asked me 
to see if Joe Sutton, the Vice Chairman of Enron, might be able to attend.  I 
will pass the information on to him.

Please ask Mr. Radtke to send an invoice to Enron, unless there is some 
better way to handle getting the money to you.

Hi Rebecca -

In fact, the Consul General of Ghana, Jack Webb, has called Ken asking him to 
meet with the Ambassador to Ghana March 10 or 11 when he will be in Houston.  
I had put a message on Ken's messages last evening asking if you could handle 
this if you are available, so hopefully he will say yes - especially after he 
sees your message.

Subject: Ghana

Ken.

I wanted to get back with regarding your question of Ghana.  You might 
remember that Ralph Hodge had indicated to you that you may well be hearing 
from the Ghanaian Ambassador.  Ralph believes that he will try to facilitate 
a meeting between you and Chevron.

We have been working Ghana pretty hard, including the West African Gas 
Pipeline, the Effasu Power Project, a marketing company and a host of other 
possibilities.  We have told the Ghanaians that with what is going on right 
now in Nigeria, the loss of projects in Cote d'Ivoire due to the coup d'etat, 
and the lack of speed in moving forward in Ghana , that we are slowing down a 
bit to determine if we can resolve current projects before taking on 
additional ones.  

Clearly this is a bit of a "cop out".  I am reluctant to tell Ghana that we 
are slowing down generally in Africa because I don't want to hurt the barge 
deal or jepordize the possible resolution of the large snowball in Mozambique 
and there is truth to the Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria issues.  And, of course, 
I don't want to alienate Ghana generally.  I have a good relationship with 
the Ambassador from Ghana, in fact, I just got a postcard from him two days 
ago, and when he returns to the US he has indicated that he will call me.  I 
will deliver this message, hopefully diverting the call to you.  If he does 
get to you first, he won't be upset for you to send him on to me, I don't 
believe.

If there is any clarification, please give me a holler.  I hope the office 
opening has gone well.  I've extracted many a promise from participants to 
drink a pint for me.

Regards
Rebecca

Hi John -

the meeting also. By way of this e-mail, I'll check with Joe's office to see

Subject: Prospective Meeting with Jim Harmon, Chairman of EXIMBank, March 15


Ken and Joe
 Jim Harmon, Chairman of EXIMBank will be in Houston March 15 and would like 
to meet with Enron to see where there are opportunities for EXIM to work more 
closely with the company.  He will be accompanied by Jeff Miller VP who 
oversees the finance operations and perhaps Barabara O"Boyle, head of the 
project finance group.  As you know we have done little with the Bank since 
Trakya. We intended to use the Bank for Dabhol 2 but were prevented to by 
sanctions imposed against India.  Joe is now on the EXIM Advisory Committee 
so it would be a good opportunity to sit down with the Bank. 
 I understand that Ken has received a letter from EXIM about the meeting and 
referred it to Joe.  I would propose that Joe lead the meeting with some of 
the regional finance people (parallel the Munoz schedule, but shorter) with a 
brief courtesy call on Ken or Ken could step in for a moment whenever he is 
available.
 I will check with Pam re Joe's availability and follow up with a memo re the 
market window initiative with EXIM where my office is heavily involved.


Barbara, I have advised our Washington office that Mr. Lay will be on this 
conference call at 3:30.  Just let us know the number for him to call.  Thank 
you.

Gary, 
Least I forget!  On N5737 the other day (11/18) Mr. Lay reported to Bill 
Reddick that when his phone (#2 R/H seat) rings and he answers that it 
disconnects on him.  He told Bill that this is the third time he has reported 
this problem.  I spoke personally with Bill about this.  We checked and there 
is no record of this problem reported recently (we checked back to May 2000) 
on all three Falcon 900's.

Lyndel checked the system and there does seem to be a problem with it 
disconnecting if you pick it up before the third ring.  After the third ring 
it works fine.  That is all I know at this time.  Garrett Av is coming over 
today to check the system.

I know you don't like emails but I didn't want this it slip by.  I've 
discussed this with Ron and John as well.

Dad,
I've drafted a Interim Construction Financing document
for the loan we previously discussed. However, I would
like to have it reviewed by Elizabeth Labonowski
(assuming she has handled some of your loans and real
estate interests previously) if you don't mind.
Unfortunately, since my contract experience is
generally in Take or Pay or join venture projects, it
is lengthier than you wanted.
Please let me know if I can have the go ahead to
contact Elizabeth and if you could have Rosalee send
me Elizabeth's e-mail address, that would be very
helpful.
Thanks,
Love,
Elizabeth

I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this is a hoax:

http://urbanlegends.about.com/culture/urbanlegends/library/blemtax2.htm

Here's an excerpt from the U.S. Postal Service's published response:

A completely false rumor concerning the U.S. Postal Service is being
circulated over the Internet via e-mail.
The e-mail message claims that a "Congressman Schnell" has introduced "Bill
602P" to allow the federal government to impose a 5-cent surcharge on each
e-mail message delivered over the Internet. The money would be collected by
Internet Service Providers and then turned over to the Postal Service.

No such proposed legislation exists. In fact, no "Congressman Schnell"
exists.

Subject: Milken Institute Conference Sponsorship



Ken,

I hope all is going well at Enron.  I know you and/or your people have been
discussing with Glenn Yago our so-called Emerging Domestic Markets Project.
It is an exciting one and we look forward to Enron's support, involvement,
participation and leadership.  Glenn will be in touch as the project
unfolds.

Now I am contacting you about our upcoming Global Conference, March 8-10,
2000 in Los Angeles.  There are two issues.

First, I am sure you are aware, we are holding our third annual Milken
Institute Global Conference March 8-10, 2000 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in
Los Angeles. A copy of the program is attached. This year's event will have
a heavy contingent of institutional investors, corporate leaders, and
technology, media and policy people in the audience.  On the program, we
have nine Nobel Laureates, several CEOs of major corporations, and other
heavy hitters.  As you can see, there is a major technology slant to this
year's program.  It will be a great event.  We would love to have some
representation from Enron in the audience.

Second, we are still accepting corporate sponsorship for the event.  I have
attached a copy of our Sponsorship Opportunities brochure that describes the
various levels ($10K - $100K), and the benefits of each sponsorship tier.
This is a great program to be associated with - both high-quality speakers
and a prestigious audience.  Mike Milken and I hope to be able to count on
your organization for support.

We anticipate a global audience of 1,500 - senior people from the financial
sector, business, technology, academia, the policy community and all the
major media.  In just two years, our Global Conference has become a
significant and influential gathering for discussion, debate and networking
on key business, economic, financial and policy questions.

I hope we can count on you.

Hi Liz -

The reason Ken and Linda were trying to reach you from the plane was that 
they had some suggestions for the hotel rooms and wanted you to know their 
preference.  They would like to give the Jasmine Suite that they are 
currently in to the Vittors with a connecting bedroom, to take care of their 
family.

They would like Mark and Natalie to have the end or corner suite that the 
Vittors have.

Ken and Linda said that they would prefer two connecting rooms, hopefully on 
the 3rd or 4th floor.  They would like for the rooms to have the ocean view 
on the North side.  If that isn't possible, it would be o.k. to overlook the 
pool, but they would not really like the south side as it wouldn't be as 
quiet.  The two rooms would give them everything they need, with 2 baths.

They said they can be reached in Switzerland tomorrow.  The Hotel Meierhof's 
phone number is:  41-81-416-82-85, Fax is:  41-81-416-39-82.  They should 
arrive in Davos about 9:00 a.m.

I know you will have a beautiful and wonderful wedding!!  Thank you so much 
for including me on the Save the Date list.  I feel honored!  Unfortunately, 
we won't be able to come.   Our "first" anniversary is June 3, but was 1961!!

Take care and call if we can do anything.

Subject: e-Katz: Chief Kroeker


Over the past week I have heard from many thoughtful and concerned citizens
about their opinions on Chief Kroeker.  About an hour ago, I held a news
conference to release the statement below in response.  I wanted to make
sure you were able to read it in its entirety.

You are a part of my e-Katz list because of your work with me or my
administration.  To be removed from the "e-Katz" distribution list, simply
reply to this e-mail with your request.  If you have multiple e-mail
addresses you use, please include a name and/or company, otherwise we may
not be able to locate the correct entry to remove.  For more information on
the Katz administration, visit our website at
http://www.ci.portland.or.us/mayor.


Statement Regarding Police Chief Mark Kroeker

"I take my responsibilities as police commissioner very seriously.  I have
reviewed this situation with care.  I want to thank those who provided me
feedback either in person, over the telephone or through e-mail.

"The performance of any individual in my administration ultimately rests
with me.  I want to apologize for the concern, pain and fear caused by the
taped comments made years ago by Chief Kroeker.  His taped comments in no
way reflect my own personal beliefs.

"My community and staff discussions, along with reading all the e-mails and
transcripts of all my telephone messages, helped distill my thinking on this
issue to one key question: Can Chief Kroeker separate his personal religious
views from his professional conduct?

"I have determined that he manages his duties without bias and will continue
to do so. His performance has met my expectations.  He is leading the bureau
in a fair, respectful and inclusive manner.  He is moving our law
enforcement efforts to a higher level of community policing.  Therefore, I
have asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief of Police.  He has my strong
support to continue.

"The law provides that all city employees have a right to their personal
religious views.  I have a responsibility to review their employment status
if their actions, as a result of their personal views, impair their ability
to perform their professional responsibilities.

"Many of the arguments raised asking me to dismiss Mark Kroeker because he
is "out of step with Portland" could be used in other Oregon communities to
fire more liberal public officials who are "out of step" with their
community's conservative majority.  My 30-year fight for tolerance goes both
ways.

"Chief Kroeker will have to rebuild trust with many of our citizens.   He
assures me he is prepared to do so.  He told me he would rather help undo
the damage, help me promote tolerance and acceptance of all people, than
just walk away.

"He commits to a strong and sustained positive dialogue with Portlanders who
are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, including those on his staff.
He has already begun outreach efforts and will continue to do so.

"He said he will redouble his efforts to promote respect and acceptance of
all Portlanders and be steadfast and fair in his enforcement of the law.

"He agrees to work with the Cascade Aids Project to serve as a spokesperson
to educate citizens about the fact that AIDS is not a "gay disease."

"He will continue to seek advice from the City Council, the Bureau's Sexual
Minority Roundtable and others to guide additional efforts.

"He agrees to take all this on with all his heart.

"In the process I hope he and we all learn from this experience.  I will
work to turn this negative situation into a positive one: to expand our
sense of tolerance; to promote the notion that regardless of a person's
personal or religious beliefs, one can be an effective public servant; and
to deepen the acceptance of all Portlanders.

"As Mayor, I will do my part and more.  I hope you will join me."

Minister's hotel to meet with him.

Dear Ken: 

As discussed I would appreciate your meeting with the CM even for a few 
minutes at Davos. I will find soem time in ur schedule to brief you for that 
meeting before you leave for Davos.

The CM considers u as a personal friend now that u have arranged for him to 
be invited to Davos. In fact he has also requested you personally whether you 
can arrange a meeting with Bill Gates while he is there. That would probably 
be impossible given everyone's schedule there and my message for that to the 
CM is going to be that eaxctly that... the schedules look impossible to 
arrange that.

However for your meeting, I would appreciate giving us some time.

Regards,
Sanjay


Dear Mr. Misaki:

Dr. Lay would prefer that the pre-meeting continue to be scheduled at 8:30 
a.m. on January 29, as he has conflicts the afternoon of January 28, so it 
would be difficult for him to attend.

Please advise.

World Economic Forum-Mr. Nishimuro's Notes
"What should be the environmental agenda for business in the 21st
century?"

.Introduction
1. Awareness of Environmental Issue
1)   Environmental issue, like Global warming, Excessive use of
natural resources, Recycling, Pollution, is of major significance.
The impact on the business is becoming to increase.
2)   The Kyoto Conference(COP3) defined an international framework
for dealing with the issue of global warming.
(The GHG reduction targets contained in the Kyoto Protocol are 6%
for Japan, 7% for the U.S.A., 8% for the EU)
Specific content for the Flexibility Mechanism/Kyoto Mechanism
(for International Emissions Trading (IET), Joint Implement (JI),
and Clean Development Mechanism(CDM)) will be decided on at COP6,
which is scheduled for November 2000.
     GHG is a serious matter requiring a globally studying.

2. GHG Reduction
1)   The relationship between GHG levels and climatic change
remains uncertain at present and further research is required.
Policies will have to be devised that take account of developments
in scientific knowledge and opinion and that also maintains
flexibility.
2)   Policy on GHG reduction must reflect the circumstances of
each country and be based on a combination of regulatory measures,
economic measures and voluntary measures.
     Excessive regulating may cause the unfairness in business
competition.

3. Energy Conservation
1)   The U.S.A. is the largest consumer of energy. In such a
large, mobile country, much
consumption is accounted for by the transportation sector.
2)   The EU has pushed many advances in environmental protection,
and has seen considerable progress in the use of renewable energy.

3)   Japan has very limited natural resources, and energy
conservation has been promoted since the oil shocks of the 1970s.
As a result, Japan is a leader in making effective use of energy,
and has the lowest level of GHG emissions against GDP.
Japan's policy is to combine regulation with voluntary measures.
Industry has supported this by promoting voluntary environmental
plans and other measures.
Japanese industries including Toshiba are to improve the energy
consumption efficiency of their products and use of energy at
their factories.

4. Programme of Industry
1)   Energy conservation is to make up the cost reduction of
products and recycling will bring about the effect on manufacturing
cost saving in the long run.

Subject: Final items of the MC



Hello John,
I hope you have returned to normal after the MC!!!  I can only say that it
was a tremendous success, and everyone should be congratulated that worked
on the planning!
Now to the final items.  We are billing everyone for the hotel, golf and
regatta this week and we have a few questions.  The hotel and golf are easy.
However the regatta is a different situation.  When we started this project,
the cost of the regatta was much less than when we finished.  We quoted
$85.00 per person, however the Millennium rate was actually $100.00 per
person.  This would not be such a great problem, however we had 33 no-shows
for the regatta.  This being said, we have two choices.  We bill those that
sailed for an additional $15.00 to make their charge $100.00 which then
leaves us with a negative $3500.00.  Or, we also bill the 33 no-shows for
$100.00 each which puts us pretty close to break even.
In the big picture, there have been some budget cost that were less than
expected and some that were more.  We will have the final budget complete by
the end of next week.
The most important issue, is it acceptable to bill those that sailed $100.00
or do you want us to stay at the original price of $85.00?......Then, of
course, what should we do about the no shows?  Possibly bill them a
cancellation fee or the full fee?  Or, forget and forgive this time?
I am leaving for Paradise tomorrow, however my trusted partner Janelle will
be here until the 20th of January.  We would like to get everything
finalized before she leaves.
Give us your thoughts.

Subject: Re: Lawsuit


Gentlemen;

You may or may not be aware, but each of you has been named as a defendant
in a lawsuit.  The lawsuit has been filed by a Plaintiff who is represented
by one of the law firms which has filed suit against i2 in the class action
lawsuit (i.e. the Nike situation).  The Plaintiff in this lawsuit is a
nominal shareholder and acts as a front for the Plaintiff law firm.

What makes the lawsuit different from the class action is that it is a
shareholder derivative lawsuit.  What this means is that the plaintiff
shareholder has filed the lawsuit against each of you to collect damages on
behalf of i2.  The claim is based on the Nike facts, but the Plaintiff is
claiming i2 has been damaged by your actions.   What is interesting is that
all damages recovered would go to i2.  So why the lawsuit?  The Plaintiff
can recover for all legal fees he incurs in bringing the lawsuit.
Derivative actions commonly follow class action filings, as a sort of
"tag-along" type of action.

The Plaintiff attorney has requested that i2 accept service of the lawsuit
on your behalf.  Normally, I would say no and let the Plaintiff law firm
try and track you down, but they may try and serve you at an inappropriate
time, i.e. client meeting, during a speech.  Please let me know if you
would like for us to accept service on your behalf.  This is very common
practice.

I will send each of you a copy of the lawsuit.  Needless to say, you are
indemnified for this, i2 will pay for all legal fees incurred to defend you
and i2 does have insurance to cover this matter.

Please let me know of your decision to have i2 accept service on your
behalf.

Thanks

I just wanted to follow up to make sure that all the arrangements for Mr

the materials for the FORUM, including the VIP pass for his car and driver
made it to you.  Please let me know if not, and I will arrange to have the

I have been in touch with Mr Bradley on input to Mr Lay's remarks, and all
seems in order on that front.

Thanks again for your help.

Oh, Gabriella (that is such a pretty name!) -

I apologize for not responding.  The conference details have been a bit 
confusing to us as we didn't seem to have many.  Mr. Lay is scheduled to 
participate in a Ministerial Working Dinner the evening of May 15.  He has to 
give a brief report on his forum session from earlier in the afternoon.  It 
is being held at the Kleber International Conference Centre.  Therefore, Dr. 
and Mrs. Lay will not be able to attend.

Thank you.

Rosalee -- I just wanted to follow up to see if there are any further
questions you (or Mr Lay) have had with regard to the OECD FORUM and IEA
Ministerial sessions scheduled for 15-16 May here in Paris.  The schedule is
as I sent it to you in April -- although there may be some changes with the
events at the Ministerial dinner.  Here, while we are still intending that
Mr. Lay provide a summary of the FORUM session to the ministerial
participants, we may need to re-order the dinner agenda slightly to
accommodate Secretary Abraham's schedule.  We will keep you posted.

I would also appreciate receiving a copy of the CV that you sent to the OECD
for our own files; we are trying to compile a full set of all participants
for use during the sessions.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,

 The Galleo mobile multimedia communicator looks very interesting.  As you

Subject: EGM - all company meeting

Ken,

Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the 
Hyatt Regency.  The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for 
an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within 
EGM.  This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we 
expect about 500 people.  

We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of 
these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have 
come in a few months.  

I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.  We had 
a record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin.  That was 50% of what they 
made in all of 2000.  Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone 
we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact.

If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way 
in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now 
core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.

Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information 
or assistance.

Mike 


John, Ken said that he does support you extending the offer.

Dear Colette:

 In response to your e-mail concerning the upcoming New Delhi World Forum, I 
would expect that this forum should evaluate the impact of what is happening 
on our project at Dabohl with reference to enticing other foreign 
investment.  As you probably know, the State of Maharastra has been slow 
paying and no paying for the electricity from our plant at Dabohl for 
sometime and more recently both the State of Maharastra  and the Government 
of India have refused to honor their government guarantees on this project.  
We have filed a political force majeure on the project and indeed will be 
moving into arbitration on that and a number of other issues in London in the 
not too distant future.  Again, I believe this will send a very negative 
signal to the market place as to the advisability of international companies 
investing in India.  I would think you might want to build one panel around 
this subject.  

 If there's any way we can be of help, let me know.

Best regards,

Ken Lay

Subject: India Economic Summit 2001, New Delhi 2-4 December


To the attention of:
Dr Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman
Enron


Dear Dr Lay,

When the Minister of Finance of India Yashwant Sinha recently presented the
2001-2002 national budget, it was widely acknowledged as a very ambitious
"dream budget" which puts India on a high growth trajectory. Most key
sectors should benefit from these reforms, which will thus give a new boost
to the country's economic and social progress. As such, the budget was
welcomed with great enthusiasm by the Indian and international business
community.

On the occasion of our India Economic Summit 2001 to be held in partnership
with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) from 2 to 4 December in New
Delhi, it will be the perfect time to assess the progress of the bold and
extensive measures proposed in the recent budget, how they have been
implemented and how they have impacted the business environment, domestic
industry activity and foreign investment.

As we will soon be preparing the preliminary programme of the Summit, I
would like to take the opportunity to benefit from your expertise and
understanding of the country. I would greatly appreciate receiving from you
any particular topics or issues that you wish to see given priority on the
agenda. Any suggestions of relevant speakers or experts that you may have
would also be welcomed.

I look forward to receiving your response at the above e-mail address and
kindly ask you to copy my colleague Mitra Khoubrou (e-mail:
mitra.khoubrou@weforum.org).

For more information on the 2001-2002 Union Budget, please visit the
website of the Ministry of Finance of India at http://finmin.nic.in/fub.htm

I look forward to hearing from you and hope that you will be with us in
India again next December.

Best regards,

Colette Mathur,
Director,
Center for Regional Strategies
World Economic Forum



Good morning, Jean - 

I understand from Rob Bradley that you are putting together some facts for 
Ken as he is moderator of this panel tomorrow in Austin.  He said that he 
would like some bullet points about basic trend data last five years re:  
natural gas production and oil production in the State.  He also would like 
facts about electricity transmission and any copies of articles about the 
subject.

Thanks.

Subject: Gerald Smith

Over the past few months, Enron Global Finance has been evaluating various 
opportunities where Enron and Smith Graham & Company may be able to work 
together.  Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at 
Smith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since 
reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a 
proposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan 
portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this 
money ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with 
Smith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about 
$235 million.)

The proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its 
quarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the 
Committiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation 
to minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is 
looking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be 
reached sometime in May.  We have not communicated the specific details of 
our intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.

I am available for further discussion at your convenience.

Regards,
Tim DeSpain

Dear Ken,

We regret that your schedule did not permit you to visit with us this week
to discuss the Center's Global Change Program.  We do understand that the
White House probably has priority.

Rosalee indicated that you are available to meet at the Center on May 24th.
the day before the Board of Trustees meeting.  May I suggest that we invite
some members of the Steering Committee to join us on the 24th to review
where we are, the political environment, and continued Center involvement
in this program area.  As you are aware we have had discussions with the
Turner Foundation on a Leadership Forum and have developed several projects
which have each received partial funding commitments from the federal
government or private foundations.    Paul O'Neill, Tim Wirth, Bill Miller,
Teresa Heinz and Michael Oppenheimer are my suggestion of Steering
Committee members to join us.  Please give me your thoughts.

As always, Mary Hope

Increasingly, Enron=01,s integrated products and services require the appro=

title, such as chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief=20
information officer or chief technology officer. These individuals may not=
=20
recognize Enron=01,s name and abilities as readily as energy-centric execut=
ives.

We also want to reach the elected and appointed officials who set policy an=
d=20
regulations affecting Enron businesses worldwide. The "Ask Why" advertising=
=20
campaign launched in February this year was designed with these groups in=

Enron commercials continue to appear on business channels such as CNBC and=

Beau, Ken would like to do this if we can arrange it.  He has a video to 
receive the United Way Kneebone Award from Gerald Smith at 2:30 on Monday, 
May 7.  I'm thinking that maybe we could do this video at 2:00 p.m.  That is 
a lot to do two videos back to back, I guess, but there is very limited time 
available and I think the United Way one will be pretty easy.  Will 30 
minutes be sufficient?

Subject: Child Advocates - Harry Reasoner



Ken -
?
Child Advocates'? 9th annual "Pull for Kids  Sporting Classic" is honoring?
Harry  Reasoner.? Lannie Earthman, at Child Avdocates, told me that they  are 
putting together a short video (a tribute to Harry) for?the night of  the 
event.? Harry doesn't know about the video so it will be a  surprise to him 
that evening.? I've been told by Lannie that, at  Macey's request, those 
being videoed are Dr. Ralph Faigan (Baylor College of  Medicine), Steve 
Miller (CEO, Shell), Malcolm Gillis (President, Rice Univ.),  and hopefully 
you.? Baylor College of Medicine is filming and producing  it.? If you would 
agree to do it, they can film you at your office at your  convenience.? It 
probably wouldn't take very long, unless of  course?you had a whole lot to 
say about Harry.? They want to have it  finished in the next couple of weeks, 
because the event is only a month away  (May 19th).
?
FYI, the Family Foundation?has always  supported the event and this year 
contributed $25,000 (the highest sponsor  level).? I don't think that you and 
Mom are planning on attending the event  or anyone else in the family.
?
Let me know if you would be interested in this so  that I can help facilitate 
it.

The proposal is totally satisfactory to Ken Lay.

Subject: CONFIDENTIAL:  HR Committee Approval Requested for Option Grant


In light of Jesse Greene's acceptance of the SVP, Strategy position, we have
re-examined his option opportunity for 2001.  As you recall, we deferred a
decision on his option grant in December 2000 pending a decision on his
status.

Now that Jesse has accepted this new role, we are recommending a grant of
125,000 stock options, which is comparable to the December 2000 grant to
other 16b officers in staff positions.  As a point of reference, below are
the option grants made to 16b officers in December 2000:

Blackmore - 375k
Winkler - 350k
Larson - 275k
McDowell - 250k
Elias - 150k
Jackson - 175k
Siekman - 155k
Napier - 155k
Fox - 125k
Milton - 100k
Clarke - 75k (received additional grant of 175k options upon appointment to
CFO)
Walker - 60k (received 250k new hire options in September)
Robison - 0 (recently received new hire grant)

If you have any questions or concerns about this proposal, please let Yvonne
or I know.  If it is acceptable, please advise and we will provide a
unanimous consent for your signature to formalize.  Thank you!

Thanks.

Subject: RE: for Rosalee - re Mr. Lay's participation at IEA ministerial


Dear Rosalee,

 I would again like to thank Mr Lay for agreeing to take part in both
our IEA ministerial session and in the OECD Forum 2001 - Sustainable
Development and the New Economy.  As discussed, he is to chair the first of
two energy panels at the FORUM; his is titled "Fuelling Sustainable
Development".  On his panel will be Mr Kurt Yeager of EPRI (speaking on
hydrocarbon issues), Mr Luis Echavarri, the head of the OECD's Nuclear
Energy Agency (speaking on nuclear power), and Danish Minister of Energy and
Environment, Svend Auken (speaking on renewables and energy efficiency).
The panel is scheduled to take place starting at 3pm at the Cit, des
Sciences et de l'Industrie, in La Villete, in northern Paris.

As I believe I noted in our previous e-mail communications, while the IEA is
responsible for organising our ministerial session and the substantive
issues related to the energy panels on the FORUM, the OECD is doing the
FORUM logistics.  They have therefore asked that I forward to all speakers
the following note (see below). It asks that Mr Lay provide a number of
logistical inputs, including a biography and photo, as well as information
on any remarks he might choose to make. I note that as the chair of the
first energy panel, he may not wish to make a formal presentation -- but
time does permit this if he wishes, and the decision is at his discretion.
I would appreciate being a cc on any material you send to the OECD so we can
keep our files current.

On our own side, the IEA concluded its Governing Board Meeting last Friday,
and finally approved the ministerial session agenda and arrangements.  While
Mr Priddle will be sending out a formal invitation and set of background
documents to Mr Lay this week, I wanted to give you a heads up and find out
if you had any "last-minute" questions which I might help answer.

In addition, I note that your last e-mail indicated Mrs Lay will be in Paris
during our session.  Some of our ministerial representatives are also
planning to bring spouses (in particular US Energy Secretary Abraham, who is
coming with his wife) -- do you think Mrs Lay might wish to participate in
any events during this period with any of these others?  If you let us know,
we would be happy to make arrangements.

Also, please let us know if others will be travelling with Mr Lay, and if we
might facilitate their logistics.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,

Jonathan Pershing

Subject: Final Draft -- SEC Report on Valuation


  Attached please find the final draft.  Tim Koller and I hope
it reflects all the changes suggested on the last conference call.  Of
course, we will never be able to satisfy everyone to the last detail, but I
think we came as close as we will get.

  There is still some proof reading and minor editing to do,
and we are working on that even as we send this off.

  To the best of my knowledge there may now be two "individual
views"  to go into what is now Attachment D.  Len Baker may feel that the
language on Safe Harbor doesn't go far enough.  Baruch Lev feels that the
SEC should not only issue a "concept release" to solicit broad public
comments on a "supplementary framework for reporting intangibles," but it
should create a task force to do the work.  (Most of the group feels this
approach is too close to asking the SEC to mandate change.)  Baruch also
feels that in relying so much on voluntary disclosure, we are exaggerating
what companies will, in fact, disclose. My suggestion, Len and Baruch, is to
write a paragraph or two for Attachment D, if you wish.  Hopefully, both of
you will begin with a sentence supporting the report in general, but if you
feel strongly that the report doesn't reflect all your views, please do
state them for the record.

  Before we schedule a final call for last minute details,
etc,  I'd like to request an e-mail, fax or phone call from each of you
letting me know if you can sign-off on the report.  I'd appreciate this by
Monday, April 16th.

  Thanks a million.

  Best regards,
  Jeff

Good morning, Liz -

I left a message at your home this morning that your Dad would like to speak 
with you when you have a chance to call.  

Rosie

p.s. - P. L. and I did early voting the first Saturday available!!  It was 
such a good feeling as Tuesdays are tough with trying to get to the office 
and leave in time to vote!!

Subject: Get out the Vote


Dear Friends and Family,
We are down to the wire and the race couldn't be
closer. Every vote counts, even those of you in Texas.
Please, remember to vote and go early, polls open at
7am across the country and close at 7pm but don't put
it off until 7pm as there could be lines and the
supervisors are not required to keep the polls open
after 7pm for those in line.
Remind your friends and family to vote and if someone
needs transportation to the polls, give them a ride or
call your local Victory 2000 office (Republicans) or
your local Democratic campaign office, they will have
people available to transport people to the polls.
Keep an eye out while you are at the polls for
electoral fraud and report any suspicious activity
including inappropriate campaigning to the poll
watchers at the polls. The Democrats and the
Republicans will have representatives at most of the
polls, let them know if there is suspicious activity.
Finally, if you have time, call your local offices and
offer your time to make phone calls to encourage
people to get out and vote, pass out leaflets, or to
be available to help prevent of voter fraud.

Finally, enjoy the evening and watch the results come
in. There are election watch parties everywhere!!!

Just one more day (and no more mass political e-mail's
from me and everyone else)!

Subject: Re: Board opportunity



Mr. Lay,
?
Your assistant contacted me a couple weeks back with the message that the  
attached was not an opportunity you could consider at this time.? Thanks  
very much, though, for taking a look at it.
?
I have one follow-up question for you -- could you recommend another Enron  
executive that might be a candidate for such an opportunity?? 
?
To help you answer the question, the company is Juno Online?Services,  
Inc.?(NASDAQ: JWEB), a leading US ISP.? Juno is very interested in  working 
with (and in advanced-stage discussions with) companies in the energy  
industry and working with them on strategic telecommunications and marketing  
partnerships.
?
Information about Juno is available at "About Juno" on Juno's Web site 
http://www.juno.com.? I've also attached an  executive summary to update you 
(or the relevant person at Enron) as to the  current status of Juno's 
business.
?
Thanks very much for your assistance, and I hope that this message finds  you 
well.
?
Best,
?
Toby
?
Executive Overview of?Juno --

The company finished 4Q00 w/ $56MM in cash.? Total net loss for 2001  was 
projected to be $10-$25MM, as the company focuses on billable services,  
continues to reduce expenses, and looks to develop advertising and other  
ancillary revenue streams.? The company is confident that it can meet  
or?beat the loss target and made explicit statements that on-hand cash  
resources are "more than adequate" to get the business profitable.? The  
company has not publicly given a time-line for profitability to maintain  
flexibility.  
The company controls one of the largest dialup subscriber audiences (4MM  
active subscribers as of 4Q00, 850K of whom are billable) on the Internet  
today and is the 4th largest US ISP (after AOL, ELNK, and MSN).  
2000 revenue came in at $114MM, 65% of which was derived from subscription  
fees and 35% from advertising.? 2001 revenues are expected to come in  
between $100MM-$120MM, with the revenue mix moving toward 80% subscription 
and  20% advertising due to increased focus on billable services and the 
soft  Internet advertising markets.  
Juno has announced broadband agreements for its Juno Express product  
covering all mainstream broadband transport platforms -- AT&T Broadband,  
Time Warner Cable, and Comcast (cable); Covad (DSL); Hughes (satellite); and  
Metricom (wireless).  
The company has announced wireless distribution agreements for it's Juno  
Mobile product with Palm and Sprint PCS.? Other agreements are likely to  be 
forthcoming.  
The company has powerful propietary technology assets that give it a  
competitive advantage.? The company has launched (internally but not  
publicly) a new business unit -- Juno Solutions -- to investigate the  
opportunity to license these technology assets to third parties both  
domestically and internationally.?  
The Juno Virtual Supercomputer Project represents another example of  Juno's 
efforts to develop ancillary revenue streams.? This distributed  computing 
initiative aims to leverage unused computer processing power from  Juno's MMs 
of subscribers, aggregating it for sale to biotech, pharmaceutical,  and 
computational chemistry firms.?

Western State Power Forum: May 22 and May 23

Plans are proceeding nicely for the Western State Forum on May 22 and May
23.  We have an outstanding group of confirmed speakers and panelists
including many individuals that I assume you know as colleagues and friends.
I will be sending you more information on the Forum in the next few days. I
am going to send you the preliminary agenda  this morning.

You will be speaking at a critical time in the Forum; that is, just after
panels on power problems and polices and just before the final session
linking power and energy strategies to environmental objectives. It would be
great if your talk to the participants in the Forum could help them see the
relationship between power and energy related objectives and environmental
issues including GHG emissions. You should feel free however to focus your
talk in a manner of your choosing. Again, I will send you the prelim. agenda
soon.  Could you send me a title however for the final agenda's purposes?
We hope to print the final agenda later this week.    Thank you.

Dear Ken,

We regret that your schedule did not permit you to visit with us this week
to discuss the Center's Global Change Program.  We do understand that the
White House probably has priority.

Rosalee indicated that you are available to meet at the Center on May 24th.
the day before the Board of Trustees meeting.  May I suggest that we invite
some members of the Steering Committee to join us on the 24th to review
where we are, the political environment, and continued Center involvement
in this program area.  As you are aware we have had discussions with the
Turner Foundation on a Leadership Forum and have developed several projects
which have each received partial funding commitments from the federal
government or private foundations.    Paul O'Neill, Tim Wirth, Bill Miller,
Teresa Heinz and Michael Oppenheimer are my suggestion of Steering
Committee members to join us.  Please give me your thoughts.

As always, Mary Hope

Subject: Duchess of Northumbria's request

Ken

Thanks for sending me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help 
with her garden project.  I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our 
view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this, we 
should say a polite "no".

The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O'Neill, 
Managing Director of Lurgi Invent.

Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really 
is difficult to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work 
for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.  However, this 
business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see 
any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent.

Given the nature of the project, the approach from the Duchess and the fact 
that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself, we really do believe no is 
the right answer.

Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to 
correspond direct with the Duchess.

Best wishes.

Colin

CEO breakfast at 8:00 am.  Our purpose there will be to tell the TFA
story and invite the CEO's present to make a commitment to help TFA
eliminate the digital divide across Houston and beyond.  At lunch,
Greg Priest, CEO of SmartForce, will be speaking. SmartForce recently
gave TFA access to all its online eLearning content.  This gift will
allow TFA to provide workforce training opportunities to half a
million persons over the next three years.  We will thank SmartForce
during the luncheon for their enormous gift which has a retail value
that could be as high as nine figures (depending on the number of
courses utilized).

      mation


To:  Bruce LaBoon, Steve Miller, Charles Duncan, Ken Lay, Steve
Letbetter, Dan Smith, Kelly Frels, Ed Galante, Jim Edmonds, Jim Kollaer

The purpose of this email is to provide additional detail to follow up on
the phone call each of you received on Friday, checking availability for
dinner with Congressman DeLay and others on Friday, April 6th.

BACKGROUND  During the last week of February, BCCA and Partnership leaders
met separately with Congressman DeLay, Congressman Joe Barton and with two
top staff members of Mr. DeLay, in order to update them on our extensive
activities aimed at federal Clean Air Act compliance.  Pursuant to those
meetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be
held in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area
on
that day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman
of the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House
Committee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has
oversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and
interaction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.

APRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's
congressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local
officials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship
channel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.
We are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.

He has asked to end the day with a "small dinner with CEOs" to have a frank
discussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called
your office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he
and the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in
addressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we
also invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.
DeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will
obviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and
advise
on strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in
attendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in
advance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before
or
after the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.

RSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim
Edmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan
and Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan
Smith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.
We will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies
to
attend the dinner.

My current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and
to arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at
a
board member's home nearby.

I trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the
Partnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with
any questions you may have.  Thank you.

CALL TO ACTION

Alliance Activists Can Make a Difference

As the country deals with a mounting energy crisis, the Department of Energ=
y
(DOE) may be planning an estimated 30-35 percent cut in the energy
efficiency and renewable energy research and development programs budget.
The Alliance calls on all responsible citizens to  encourage the
administration to do the right thing.  Becoming an Alliance Activist is the
first step.

Senator Bingaman, Democrats, Introduce Centrist Energy Bill

Senator Jeff Bingaman (NM), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee and Chair of the Alliance to Save Energy,
introduced comprehensive legislation to shape the nation's energy policy.
``If we want to tackle [our energy] problem[s] head-on, we need a
comprehensive plan that commits to increasing domestic production and to
using energy more efficiently throughout the economy.  I believe this
legislation sets out that plan," Bingaman said.

Secretary Abraham Looks for Energy in Wrong Places

Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, addressing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
noted:  =01&America faces a major energy supply crisis over the next two
decades.=018  But Abraham, like President Bush, is looking mainly to increa=
se
our supply of oil, coal, and natural gas, rather than approach both the
supply and demand sides of the issue.  Secretary Abraham mentioned energy
efficiency only once in his entire speech, even though a reduction in deman=
d
is the quickest, cleanest, cheapest (and most reliable!) energy source at
our disposal.

Democratic Task Force Weighs in on Bush Budget

Last week, House Democrats threw their hat into the ring as the Democratic
Caucus Energy Task Force held a news conference decrying Bush Administratio=
n
intentions to cut energy research significantly in their FY 2002 budget.
The Alliance is quoted in their report, which emphasizes the role of
research and development in providing long-term energy solutions.

Senate Hearing Examines Energy-Environmental Relationship

Alliance president David Nemtzow testified at a March 21 Senate Environment
Committee Subcommittee hearing on the relationship of energy policies and
environmental policies.  Nemtzow pointed out that energy efficiency is now
our nation=01,s second largest energy source.  He also offered a series of
recommendations for the Senators simultaneously to promote energy and
environmental goals.

IPCC: Energy Efficiency is Key in Mitigating Climate Change

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the third and
final volume of its Third Assessment Report on climate change, which
examines climate change mitigation strategies and places a heavy emphasis o=
n
using energy wisely. The report finds that energy efficiency for buildings,
transportation, and industry could account for more than half of the
potential greenhouse gas reductions achievable by 2020. Natural gas
technologies, more efficient power plant technologies, and combined heat an=
d
power play an important role in reducing fossil energy power plant
emissions. And "low-carbon energy systems," such as renewable energy, can
also make an important contribution. Perhaps equally important is the
finding that there is "no single path to a low emission future."

Barriers to Energy Efficiency In Public, Private Organizations

There is a gap between the opportunities for cost-effective energy-
efficiency investment identified in energy models and the levels actually
seen in practice, according to SPRU, a science and technology policy
research group in England. The origins of the gap are claimed to lie in a
series of barriers, such as lack of capital, lack of information or hidden
costs, which prevent markets for energy and energy-using technologies from
operating efficiently.  SPRU says that understanding the size and nature of
this gap is essential if policies to mitigate climate change through
improved energy efficiency are to be successful. These policies must succee=
d
in the context of liberalizing energy markets and increasing interest in th=
e
development of a broadly based energy service industry.

State of the World Report

From the thinning of the Arctic sea ice to the invasion of the
mosquito-borne West Nile virus, the Worldwatch Institute's State of the
World 2001 shows how the economic boom of the last decade has damaged
natural systems.   The report takes a fresh look at the most difficult
challenge the world faces: how to build an environmentally sustainable
economy before we do permanent damage to the natural systems that support
our global civilization.

Dallas Cleans the Air with the IECC Energy Code

The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) voted this month to
adopt the 2000 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) for the Dallas
region.  This area accounts for almost 50,000 housing starts a year, more
than are built in 42 states.  One of the main reasons for adopting the code
is the area's commitment to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as part of the
Texas state plan for controlling smog.  Since the IECC contains a new
standard for reducing window solar heat gain, which reduces air conditionin=
g
energy use substantially, it cuts NOx emissions from the power plants that
serve the air conditioning load.  The Alliance supported Public Citizen, th=
e
Texas Building Energy Institute, the Sustainable Living Alliance, NCTCOG
staff, and others in this effort, working with the Building Codes Assistanc=
e
Project and Alliance Associates.

Energy Efficiency Facts Even Children Can Understand

A vacant house at 55 Fahrenheit uses more energy for heating than an
occupied one at 68 Fahrenheit, according to GPU Energy.  The activity in an
occupied house radiates a certain amount of heat and some of the energy
users in your home are still operating while you areaway. Designed
specifically for teachers and students, the GPU website features
energy-related games, activities, experiments, downloadable teaching

Subject: Dinner with Tom DeLay and others on April 6th -- additional infor 
mation


To: Bruce LaBoon, Steve Miller, Charles Duncan, Ken Lay, Steve
Letbetter, Dan Smith, Kelly Frels, Ed Galante, Jim Edmonds, Jim Kollaer

The purpose of this email is to provide additional detail to follow up on
the phone call each of you received on Friday, checking availability for
dinner with Congressman DeLay and others on Friday, April 6th.

BACKGROUND  During the last week of February, BCCA and Partnership leaders
met separately with Congressman DeLay, Congressman Joe Barton and with two
top staff members of Mr. DeLay, in order to update them on our extensive
activities aimed at federal Clean Air Act compliance.  Pursuant to those
meetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be
held in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area on
that day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman
of the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House
Committee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has
oversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and
interaction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.

APRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's
congressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local
officials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship
channel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.
We are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.

He has asked to end the day with a "small dinner with CEOs" to have a frank
discussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called
your office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he
and the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in
addressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we
also invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.
DeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will
obviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and advise
on strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in
attendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in
advance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before or
after the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.

RSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim
Edmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan
and Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan
Smith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.
We will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies to
attend the dinner.

My current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and
to arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at a
board member's home nearby.

I trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the
Partnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with
any questions you may have.  Thank you.

Subject: Duchess of Northumbria's request

Ken

Thanks for sending me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help 
with her garden project.  I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our 
view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this, we 
should say a polite "no".

The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O'Neill, 
Managing Director of Lurgi Invent.

Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really 
is difficult to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work 
for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.  However, this 
business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see 
any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent.

Given the nature of the project, the approach from the Duchess and the fact 
that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself, we really do believe no is 
the right answer.

Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to 
correspond direct with the Duchess.

Best wishes.

Colin




Hi Carolyn -

Human Scale


Dear Dr. Lay:

New this week on www.TheGlobalist.com:

RUDI DORNBUSCH ON INCOME INEQUALITY
Poverty is bad -- but income inequality is not. MIT Professor Rudi
Dornbusch makes the argument that the development community
should not confuse inequality with poverty -- even though at the
bottom they might feel the same.

Coming Monday: A New Globalist Paper
PRICING AIDS MEDICATIONS TO A HUMAN SCALE
In a scramble for good publicity, pharmaceutical companies have
started a downward bidding war in pricing AIDS medications for
African markets. To add a much-needed measure of fairness to
the process, we propose a better alternative -- adjusting the price
of treatment to per-capita GDP.

Best regards from Washington,

Stephan Richter

OPEC ANNOUNCE 1M BBL/D CUTS
Geneva - OPEC members agreed further production cuts this week, announcing a
further 1m bbl/d decrease in member outputs. As a result oil prices pushed
slightly higher with NYMEX crude trading at $26.80 and IPEC crude trading at
25.06. OPEC ministers have indicated that members have highlighted $25/bbl
as a price that they feel comfortable with.The decreases per country were as
follows:

Algeria - 32,000
Indonesia - 52,000
Iran - 146,000
Kuwait - 80,000
Libya - 54,000
Nigeria - 82,000
Qatar - 26,000
Saudi Arabia - 324,000

Total - 1,000,000


ENERGY AFRICA LOOK TOWARD THE MOROCCAN DEEP
Rabat - This week the MENA Petroleum Bulletin spoke with Andrew Windham,
Group General Counsel for Energy Africa. Amina Benkhadra, General Manager of
ONAREP (25%) added to the growing list of re-entrants to Morocco, signing a
petroleum agreement with Energy Africa (63.75%) and Taurus Petroleum AB
(11.25%). This agreement, taking effect March 1st 2001, concerned three
exploration permits offshore Morocco collectively known as the Tiznit
Offshore area.
Energy Africa Morocco Ltd (operator), together with Taurus Petroleum
(co-partner) will implement exploration work on the three permits of the
Tiznit Offshore area covering approximately 6000sq.km. This is Energy
Africa's second Petroleum Agreement covering acreage offshore Morocco, the
first being the Cap Draa Haute Mer area where Energy Africa holds 20% equity
bringing the total acreage held by it in the country to 18,000sq.km.
Andrew Windham, said, 'the country has all the characteristics offshore
which make potentially, for substantial discoveries. But at this stage it is
very much untried and untested, so it is a very exciting place to be at the
moment. We are in right at the start of some new plays.'
For further details please see the April issue of the MENA Petroleum
Bulletin.


REPSOL MAKE 2ND LIBYA DISCOVERY
London - Repsol YPF SA said it discovered oil at a second well during
exploration in Libya. The well in the Murzuq Basin, 800km south of Tripoli,
produced oil at a rate of 1,300bbl/d, the company said in a press release.
Repsol is testing the site on behalf of a consortium including OMV,
TotalFinaElf and Saga Petroleum. Repsol began searching for oil in the area
in May 1998, when the Libyan government granted approval for exploration and
production sharing arrangements with foreign companies. The companies
currently produce more than 160,000bbl/d from the Murzuq Basin, said the
company.


AHMED ABDELKARIM CONFIRMED AS NEW HEAD OF NOC
Tripoli - Further to reports this week from Libya Ahmed Abdel-Karim Ahmed
has been formally appointed as Chairman of NOC, following reports that he
had been removed from the position. Representing Libya at the OPEC
conference in Geneva it was confirmed that Al-Badri has been appointed as
Deputy Prime Minister for Social Security. The news will comfort foreign
investors who feared that further upheaval would hinder an already slow
ratification process, with approvals outstanding for three packages of
blocks offered by NOC in late 2000.

products. Specifically, the Report will provide you with a complete analysis

MENA POWER
23 & 24th April 2001, Crowne Plaza Hotel, Dubai
For further information visit
http://www.smi-online.co.uk/middleeastpower2.asp

The timing of this conference couldn't be better as the Middle East and
North African region gears up to offer further independent power projects.

SMi forthcoming conference titled Middle East North African Power, taking
place 23rd and 24th April 2001 aims to bring together all levels of
participants to explain their understanding and thinking for the future of
Middle East and North African power development.

Many countries experience blackouts and electrical faults on a daily basis,
governments in the Middle East and North Africa are now increasingly pinning
their hopes on the Independent Power Project run in conjunction with major
International investors to solve this problem.   Relaxation of Middle East
law has allowed outside investment and many see this moving the Middle East
power industry towards privatisation.

Key Speakers at this event include:
* Engineer Mahmoud Al-Ees, Head of Planning Studies, Ministry of Energy and
Mineral Resources - Jordan
* Dr Ranald Spiers, Regional Director Middle East & Africa, National Power
Plc
* Steve Wildman, Commercial Director, Alstom Gas Turbines
* Tom Thomason, Project Manager, InterGen
* Daniel J. Meier, Area Sales Manager, ABB High Voltage Technologies
* Dr Thomas Stauffer, International Oil and Finance Consultant (Formerly
with M.I.T)

MENA Power takes place on 23rd & 24th April 2001 at the Crowne Plaza Hotel,
Dubai.  The full conference programme is available at

http://www.smi-online.co.uk/algeria.asp

The Aims & Objectives of the Conference

Algeria has always attracted a large amount of interest from the
international oil and gas community.  With a new licensing round under
discussion and petroleum code under review, this conference aims to act as a
forum for all aspects of the oil and gas industry to come together and
discuss the future development of Algeria's oil and gas sector.  Moving away
from the traditional investing in format of conference, this forum aims to
look at specific field studies and also the future markets and developments
within the Algerian oil and gas industry.  It will focus on the commercial

Hi Philippe -

Ken asked me to request that you call the above referenced gentleman.  He was 
referred by a friend of Ken's.  He wants to see if his oil on-line business 
is a fit for us.  Ken said he has no idea whether it will work or not, but 
please give him a courtesy call.

Just a reminder that your portfolio company presentations are due on Monday

has a copy to include in the mailing paket to him by 4PM on Monday.  If you 
are not planning to meet that deadline, please see Lilia about how you can 
get your presentation to Gene.

The first drafts were a good start.  Most, however, read more like a pitch  
[Paige, Barbara]  than an assessment/evaluation.  As you make your revisions, 
keep in mind that your objective should be to provide a succinct, but 
thorough assessment of the investment that will inform a discussion on how to 
best add value and manage the investment going forward.

If you have not gotten my feedback and would like it, we can arrange to speak 
over the weekend.  I will be traveling, but if you leave a voice message, we 
can arrange a time to speak.  I will be generally available by phone Saturday 
morning through early afternoon.

Hi Jonathan -

E-mail is great.  I have copied Tori Wells on this also, as she works 
diligently on Dr. Lay's itineraries and Rob Bradley, who works on Dr. Lay's 
speeches.  We have virtually no information about the OECD Forum or the IEA 
Ministerial session except dates - May 15-16.  We have made reservations for 
Dr. & Mrs. Lay at the Bristol Hotel.  

We look forward to hearing from you.

Rosalee --  I was given your name by Bill Ramsay as the person responsible
for co-ordinating Mr Lay's participation at the May IEA Ministerial session.
From the IEA side, I have been tasked with the responsibility for
co-ordinating not only parts of the Ministerial session, but also the
preceding OECD Forum -- in both of which Mr. Lay is scheduled.

I am hoping to be in closer communication with you to walk through our
current planning for these meetings, and to make sure that all our i's are
dotted and t's are crossed as we move toward May.  Please let me know
whether e-mail or a telephone call would be best.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Hi Rosalee-- I just wanted to thank you so much for your extra help on our
inquiry to Ken.  We understand completely that the April 25 slot following
his return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's
always easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given recently
can easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of
my previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May to
the World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we
would work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new
content.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I
mentioned the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when it
comes to the idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy markets
and business enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and
don't hesitate to ever ask for a "quid pro quo" from us.

Dear Nicolas:

I am pleased that you found the Cancun meeting to be a good experience.  My 
wife and I also thought if was a very enjoyable couple of days.

With reference to contacting the appropriate people representing Enron in 
Mexico, you should contact either Jaime Alatorre or Max Yzaguirre.  Either 
one of these individuals could entertain a discussion of how we might be able 
to work together.

Thank you for making yourself available this afternoon. We want to apprise
you of recent developments and our planned responses.  The regular Board
Meeting is scheduled for next week. This may not be required in view of the
discussions we'll have this afternoon.  We'll confirm this afternoon whether
the Board Meeting is required.


I am disappointed that Joe Grundfest will not be able to join us at our next 
Advisory Council meeting.  However Tom Campbell sounds like an excellent 
alternative.  Would you please contact him and see if he might be willing to 
join us for the next meeting and talk about the subjects you suggested.  
Incidentally, we're happy to pay an honorarium to any of our guest speakers. 

I think I should pass at this time on inviting Spence Abraham to join us for 
dinner.  First, I believe it would be virtually impossible for him to do that 
at this point in time.  But second, many people are already blaming me for 
being the real energy policy maker in the new Administration and I would just 
as soon not feed that speculation.  

Look forward to seeing you.  

Warm regards,

Ken

Joe and I hve had several conversations trying to work out his schedule, but
his classes plus moving his parents from NYC to California at that time make
it impossible for him to come, although he would very, very much like to do
so.
I would suggest that we invite Tom Campbell, the Republican congressman who
just lost his shot at the senate against one of the two women (I forget which
one, left or lefter) and who is again teaching at Stanford Law School. He is
brilliant, and we could give him the topic of "Enron and Market-Regulatory
Failure: What Are The Constraints on Its Behavior? Where Do the Risks Lie in
the Future?" Or some such thing.
I will read When Genius Fails in the next few hours and decide about its
author.
What would you think of having Spence Abraham to dinner, and moving Bill
Kristol to the morning if Spence can come?

Freedom of Press 'under threat' in Russia, campaigners claim

Russia's provincial media is struggling to maintain its freedoms in the face
of politically motivated assaults, campaigners claim.

Oleg Panfilov, chief of the Centre for Journalism in Extreme Situations,
said: "A new state propaganda machine is being created in the federal
districts, with new state-run newspapers, new state-run news agencies, new
state-run TV channels."

Fyodor Penkin, chief editor of the Volga Times, who survived a shotgun
attempt on his life earlier this year, said: "Ten years ago, when I was
creating this newspaper, I felt for the first time that I can write freely.
Now this child I have created is dying before my eyes."

Media's role in Ghana's presidential election praised

Ghana's acting ambassador to the US has offered a glowing account of the
role played by his country's media in the recent presidential election.

Francis Tsegah said radio in particular played a significant part in
ensuring the success of the election - Ghana's first multi-party one.

He said:  "The press covered the parties and were able to send information
to the public in such a way that by the time you had the election there was
no longer any question of the media being biased towards one party."

The election was won by opposition candidate John Kufuor.

Malaysia increases pressure on media

Malaysia has increased pressure on both foreign and domestic media, by
branding people involved in award-winning news site Malaysiakini.com
"traitors" and delaying the distribution of the latest issues of Asiaweek
and the Far Eastern Economic Review (FEER).

Prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said of Malaysiakini: "People who love
Malaysia would not support Malaysiakini. Previously people would say
traitors but these people really behave like traitors, asking foreigners to
harm their own country."

Two Asiaweek issues and one of FEER - all carrying articles on Malaysia -
were stuck in distributions depots, and FEER Managing Editor Michael
Vatikiotis said: "We have no indication as to whether this is just a one off
or part of a policy. We have had no official communication."

Asiaweek is part of the AOL-Time Warner stable, and FEER part of Dow Jones.

Taiwan vows to safeguard free speech over controversial book

Taiwan's President Chen Shui-ban has vowed to safeguard the island's freedom
of speech as a row over a controversial Japanese comic book continued to
divide the state.

The book claimed that many Taiwanese women, forced to act as sex slaves to
Japanese soldiers during World War Two, were volunteers. Some politicians
demanded the cartoonist be denied a visa to visit Taiwan while others
insisted that he be allowed his freedom of speech.

BBC's Sambrook pledge to "get below the hype"

BBC News director Richard Sambrook has vowed to improve the quality of his
empire's output by better integrating its disparate parts, and "getting
below the hype".

In an interview with The Times' media editor, Ray Snoddy, Sambrook, who
officially takes the director's chair this week from the departing Tony
Hall, says he is running a "fantastic operation". But, he admits, it
"misfires slightly as we go down the road. We do not quite pack the punches
that we ought to".

Sambrook says he has discussed how best to coordinate journalists in the UK
regions, and World Service, with senior BBC executives.

Broadcasters face curbs in Singapore

Foreign broadcasters who "engage in the domestic politics of Singapore"
could soon face restrictions.

Information and Arts Minister Lee Yock Suan said he was set to introduce a
bill that would allow the government to restrict distribution of a broadcast
service if the company was deemed to be meddling in the city-state's
internal affairs.

Singapore's Newspaper Act can ban distribution of a newspaper or magazine
and has been used against The Economist and Asian Wall Street Journal, but
up until now broadcasters have been left alone.

Lee said foreign media operated in Singapore as a matter of privilege, not
of right.

He added: "Our aim is not to ban information but to restrict subscriber and
advertising revenue to an errant channel."

Australia's ABC must decentralise to lessen Sydney bias, MD says

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation must decentralise both staff and
activities to prevent it from becoming a Sydney mouthpiece, managing
director Jonathan Shier said.

Shier said that by June 2003, the ABC wanted to increase its
non-news/current affairs production in centres other than Sydney or
Melbourne by 40 percent.

He also said that the internet had its place within media and should not be
sidelined just because of the recent dot com gloom.

Unions claim that the decentralisation talk is just a "stalking horse for
getting rid of staff".

Journalist Ware reportedly offered safe house by BBC

The BBC has reportedly offered a safe house to Panorama reporter John Ware,
the journalist most closely associated with the expose on the Omagh bombing.

According to the Times newspaper, the Corporation has also offered Ware
personal protection.

The bomb blast outside the BBC's west London centre is being blamed on the
Real IRA, who may have acted in revenge over the Panorama reports.

Meanwhile, speculation that the BBC might move flagship current affairs
programme Panorama back to a weekday slot - but on BBC2 - refuses to go
away.

MediaGuardian quotes an 'insider' as saying: "Sunday may just have been a
transition. If it moved to a weekday slot, possibly even to BBC2, it would
increase its audience and get more share."

The BBC has insisted that Panorama will remain in its Sunday night slot,
despite opposition from some prominent figures, including Ware.

Indonesian copies of Time censored by distributor

The Indonesian distributor of Time Magazine censored pictures of headless
corpses -victims of the ethnic bloodshed in Indonesia's Central Kalimantan
province - in the Asian edition of the magazine, as he feared it would
incite more violence.

The front cover image and photographs inside the magazine, where decapitated
bodies were shown, were blacked out by hand in all copies being sent to
Indonesia. The distributor said it had not come under pressure from the
government to censor the pictures.

Time journalist Jason Tedjasukmana said he was concerned that the move could
lead to other companies taking censorship into their own hands.

UK broadcasters on guard against online poll rigging in Election run-up

The UK's top broadcasters have pledged to be on alert for attempts by
political activists to rig online polls in the run up the General Election.

The BBC's assistant director of news Mark Damazer told how the Corporation
had ran a poll during its Europe week coverage, only to inadvertently
receive an e-mail from a pressure group asking its supporters to '"keep
e-mailing this site, we need to get in as many votes as we can".

And ITN's editor-in-chief Richard Tait said: "We are going to be extremely
careful not to allow any online polling to be hijacked by an individual
group."

Dear Mr. Lay,

     Enron's  dynamic growth in the field of energy
during the last three years is truly remarkable. As a
student of business, I am truly impressed by the
strategic acquistions made by Enron in the area of
power and its leveraged arbitrage with the gas
industry.
     I would very much like to make a career within
Dynegy and would appreciate very much if you would

Hi Rosalee-- I just wanted to thank you so much for your extra help on our
inquiry to Ken.  We understand completely that the April 25 slot following
his return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's
always easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given recently
can easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of
my previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May to
the World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we
would work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new
content.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I
mentioned the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when it
comes to the idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy markets
and business enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and
don't hesitate to ever ask for a "quid pro quo" from us.

We plan to distribute the final draft by mid-March in time for you to take

also for you to submit any supplementary views for inclusion. My suggestion
is that views be kept to a few paragraphs, if possible. For those who wish

a slightly different emphasis on some aspect of the report, or you could
underline some aspect that you are especially enthusiastic about and believe
deserves more attention.

When we send the next draft to you I'll try to propose something about how
we might release the report, but I would appreciate any suggestions you have
about that.

Here are two proposed dates for our next conference call. Please indicate

Jim:
It was a pleasure speaking with you on Wednesday.  Based on our conversatio=
n,=20
this email includes the following:

An Enron contact to discuss developing small-scale generation on Tribal lan=
ds.

Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h=
ow=20
to remove those impediments.

A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR=01,s ability=
 to=20
sign contracts with power suppliers, and options to resolve them. Two=20
possible options for addressing the credit issue are 1) a California PUC=20
order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through=20
rates, and 2) an amendment to AB1X designed to accomplish the same goal.  I=
=20
have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose=
d=20
amendments to AB1X.  We believe that an amendment to AB1X is the preferable=
=20
option.

Our assessment of the supply/demand picture in California.

Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near-=
=20
and long-term electricity crisis in California.  We will deliver to your=20
office today detailed legislative language.  In those materials we will als=
o=20
identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed=
=20
language.

I hope that the information is useful.  Please do not hesitate to contact m=
e=20
if you would like to discuss these materials further, or if there is anythi=
ng=20
else that I can do to assist you.

Regards,
Ken Lay

2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation

Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges

Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took=
 a=20
step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20
designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20
monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t=
he=20
elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20
1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for=
=20
California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc=
e=20
the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20
offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o=
f=20
distributed generation.
=20
Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20
investor-owned and municipal utilities

Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =
a=20
step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20
interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=
=20
requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20
generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=
=20
interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=
=20
through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20
possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=
e=20
utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20
accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.

Permitting and Air Quality Issues
Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=
 or=20
greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=
d=20
therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20
generation faces. =20

Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru=
=20
D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=
=20
output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil=
ities.=20
In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=
=20
face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20
interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=
. =20
These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.

3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=
=20
Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20

Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=
=20
suppliers.
Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=
e=20
goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.
However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=
=20
concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.
We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=
redit=20
risk concerns.
Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=
=20
is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=
=20
both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=
=20
going forward.

Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue

Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority
The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20
charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=
=20
analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20
California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =
As=20
such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=
es=20
adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.

Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018
The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=
=20
=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=
use to=20
allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20
purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=
ee=20
to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=
=20
DWR has entered into with suppliers.
=20
Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=
=20
Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases
In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=
=20
noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=
=20
the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=
oy to=20
permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=
s=20
extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=
re=20
DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =
is=20
difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=
=20
rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=
=20
costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=
=20
suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=
=20
from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.

Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20

We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=
sk=20
issues.  We have identified three options:

Amend AB1X
The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=
=20
PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=
red by=20
DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =
to=20
ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=
=20
preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=
=20
challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20
entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)

Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20
through Contract Language
This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20
implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=
re=20
time to implement than the "legislative" fix.  We have attached electronic=
=20
copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=
=20
would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20
=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)

Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk
As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=
cept=20
other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=
=20
cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=
=20
indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=
=20
prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=
=20
contract amendments.

4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001

Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20
Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=
=20
showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=
r=20
only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=
l=20
credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=
=20
of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20
likely. =20

CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20
summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20
estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=
 well=20
below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=
n=20
in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=
=20
than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20
unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=
o=20
date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=
he=20
flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20
California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =
this=20
requirement. =20

Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=
=20
draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=
re=20
supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=
=20
number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20
utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=
t=20
pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=
=20
added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.

CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=
=20
rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20
optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=
=20
MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=
=20
should view the CEC's "rosy scenario" with considerable skepticism.

5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=
=01,s=20
Electricity Crisis

This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=
l=20
deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=
=20
bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.

As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20
crisis must focus on four issues:

Increase supply
Decrease demand
Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market
Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency

Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)
To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =
=20
Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=
=20
than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.

The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=
slation=20
are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=
se=20
efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=
=20
in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20
requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=
=20
proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20
transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20
innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20
emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=
ir=20
districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20
required reductions in pollution emissions.

Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)
Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=
=20
the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=
=20
best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=
st=20
effectively and quickly in two ways:

Buy-down demand
California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=
d=20
to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=
 more=20
economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=
ld=20
be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=
=20
through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20
determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20
participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20
necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20
reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=
eal=20
Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.

Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment
To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:

An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=
=20
for hour-ahead power in real time.=20
Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=
=20
verification.
Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=
=20
paid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).

The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=
e:

=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=
cularly=20
in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=
=20
resources.
reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20
electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =
in=20
the state.
fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=
k=20
of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20
customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=
=20
responding.=20

We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=
=20
excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=
=20
summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate=
=20
that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=
s=20
that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20
directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20
control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.

Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=
cle:=20
SB27X
The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=
re=20
customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=
=20
service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=
=20
customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=
e=20
prohibition against Direct Access.

Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=
=20

Mr. Lay--

During the negotiations with the Rockets as to how much each party would
contribute to the Arena referendum campaign, Mike Goldberg of Baker & Botts
suggested that the Rockets would like to net their contribution obligation
against other contributions that they solicited.

After a conversation with you, John Watson and I advised Mike Goldberg that
you did not want to be competing with the Rockets in soliciting
contributions to the Arena referendum campaign.

Mike Goldberg called Friday and asked whether it would be acceptable for the
Rockets to net against their contribution obligation contributions that they
have solicited from Baker & Botts, Jim MacInvale and Tilman Fertitta.  Mike
suggested that these three persons would be the only outside persons that
would be solicited by the Rockets.

Would you please let me know if this is acceptable to you.  You or Rosalee
may call me at 713-758-2350 or send me a response e-mail at

Ken and Jeff,

As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the 
Enron Associate program for several years now.  I also recently have become 
involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which 
provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.  They 
are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will 
include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their 
company's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to 
ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would 
really highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a "Core School" in 
the MBA recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for 
March 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.

Kevin

Kevin-


Just a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding Enron's
participation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week and the
possibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had a
chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on
you plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. 
Below is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all
is well with you.


            Nov.2 email text


We at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link
with Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the
agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable
markets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like
Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic
Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and
beyond.


The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. 
First, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key
speaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As
described in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three
conferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and
students.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a "live
case study" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,
2001</underline>.


You, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this
is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay
and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and
the Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the
corporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken
Chenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced
President of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a
distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in
continually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  


We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership
Week, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman
Sachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company
and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank
Rhodes, but these are still long shots.


The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the
Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted
a platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If
they can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the
date is March 28, 2001.       


The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same
lines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it
could become the basis for the March conference live case study
presentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to
literally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage
an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place
that you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to
be the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and
practices make this possible.


I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around
1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and
leadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to
building this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer
from the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the
Enron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast
moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient
way.


Kevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and
hopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to
make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. 
Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As
always, thanks for your great personal support.

Good morning, Michael.  Will there be enough funds to help Sue without 
Shell's if I wait until Mr. Lay returns on October 3?  I have not been very 
successful getting faxes through to the ship, so would prefer not to have to 
bother him with this unless absolutely necessary.

Subject: Referendum Campaign


Mr. Lay--

I have been assisting John Watson with his representation of Sports
Facilities, L.P., and I am in the process of coordinating the $1.4 million
prepayment by the Sports Authority and the contribution of such amount by
the partners to the referendum campaign.

Assuming that we receive the prepayment from the Sports Authority, we expect
to be able to start making contributions to the referendum campaign this
week.  The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign by the
partnership, on behalf of each partner, upon receipt of instructions from
each such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributed
to the campaign instead of being distributed.  I have discussed this
procedure with Sue Walden.

With respect to your arrangement with Shell, we were not sure what you and
Shell had agreed to.  The monies being contributed to the referendum
campaign are being contributed to a special purpose political action
committee (as required by law).  This special purpose PAC is subject to the
general Texas laws that govern campaign fundraising.  As you know, one of
these laws provides that "a person may not knowingly make or authorize a
political contribution in the name of or on behalf of another unless the
person discloses in writing to the recipient the name and address of the
person actually making the contribution . . . ."   Pending a better
understanding of the Shell arrangement, we will hold Shell's $100,000 in the
partnership's account.

Please contact John Watson at 713-758-2556 or me at 713-758-2350 if you have
any questions regarding the foregoing.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Telle



Good morning, Joe.  Ken is on a cruise, so is not available, but I did talk 
to Steve (he is traveling, but said he is trying to get in touch with you).  
Apparently, everything is still internal.  He said everything is fine, so 
hopefully, you don't need to be concerned.

Talk to you soon.

Subject: Selection Of My Successor-My Concern

Ken: I have "heard" from two sources in this office that Enron will announce 
my successor today. I have not been advised of the selection and am concerned 
that this announcement will not treat my retirement in an appropriate and 
deserving manner.

I have placed calls to Steve Kean since hearing this rumor but have not 
received a response as of now. Admittedl, our phone service because of the 
office construction is not totally functioning.

Frankly, I think this matter has not been handled in a caring way and I have 
been acccused of giving information on the selection to Tom DeLay which is 
untrue. My office mates are all more aware of the candidates and their status 
than I have been.

I regret having to contact you on this matter but feel that despite my total 
cooperation, allegiance and dedication to Enron, I am not being treated with 
the courtesy and sensitivity that this matter deserves.

Joe

Subject: Attached paper and September 27 Panel Meeting


Dear  Ken,

 I am sorry to say that earlier this week Arthur Levitt was called to
testify in Congress early on September 28, and he felt unable to make our
session as originally planned. It is my hope that we can reschedule with him
prior to -- or in conjunction with -- the final report. For those who may
have changed their schedules to make this meeting because of the chance to
talk to Arthur, I regret the inconvenience.

 In deference to your time, we'll go ahead with the meeting from 5 to
7 but not with the dinner.

 Here are the details of the meeting.  Note that the location is
different from the previous two meetings.

     Wednesday, September 27 from 5 to 7
p.m.
     McKinsey & Company
     52 East 52nd Street, 23rd Floor
     New York, NY
     Check in on 23rd floor with Carol
Hubbard, who will direct you to the conference room
Phone: 212-446-8836

 Attached is the draft of our final report, prepared by Tim Koller.
It will be the subject of the meeting.  We will want to gather your comments
on the following:

     1.  Do you agree with the substance
of this draft?
     2.  Are there points that should
receive more or less emphasis?
     3.  Are there any other issues you
would like to raise?
     4.  Is there anything else about the
drafting and presentation that you would
like to comment on?

 We will need to get everyone's comments, one way or another, by the
end of September so we can proceed to prepare the final paper, which we'd
like to have ready by the end of October.

 Originally you said that you would not be able to make the meeting.
Could you let us know if your plans have changed and you can now come or
participate by phone?  See below for reply.

   ____ I will be there

   ____  I will participate by phone

               ____ I cannot make it at all but will
e-mail comments by September 30

 Many thanks,

Subject: New PUHCA Exemption Legislative Language

Yesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the 
attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for 
companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by 
independent market analysts (i.e. "A" rating for Holding Companies or 
investment grade rating for utility companies).  This is not a permanent 
exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.

MidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's 
reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, 
Ken Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.

The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an 
amendment to a "must pass" piece of legislation during the waning days of 
this Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' 
strategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes 
tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as 
contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to 
paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth 
Edison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. 
2944).

Senator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA 
amendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed 
to the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've 
reviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the 
concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was 
Senator Kerrey's idea.  

It is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) 
would still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact 
that Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the 
Democrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not 
he is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive 
electricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is "at least 
three years away from happening."

Steve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position 
on this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to 
oppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like 
Southern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the 
MidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access 
provisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support.

To the attention of:
Dr Kenneth L. Lay

ENRON CORPORATION

Mexico Meeting 2000
Managing New Expectations and Old Challenges
Mexico City, Mexico 4-5 December

Dear Dr Lay,

Mexico awoke to a new political landscape on 2 July 2000. The economic and 
business climate is positive and full of new opportunities as Mexico finally 
completes a long transition from one-party dominance to pluralist democracy, 
adding political maturity to a more competitive market economy.

In light of the above, the World Economic Forum will hold a Mexico Meeting 
2000 on 4-5 December in Mexico City. Held in collaboration with the Mexican 
Investment Board, this gathering will take place three days after the 
inauguration of the new Mexican administration. We have already received 
confirmation that President-elect Vicente Fox and Mexican Central Bank 
Governor Guillermo Ortiz will participate. We are also expecting the presence 
of the future key cabinet members and state governors.

As usual, the World Economic Forum pulls together the right group of leaders 
to discuss issues, build a network of contacts and identify where future 
business opportunities and risks lie. The Meeting will focus on four main 
topics: the country's political and social agenda, Mexico's commercial 
relationships with the rest of the world, the new economy and the key issues 
for the country's main industries.

Please consult our website, http://www.weforum.org/mexico, where information 
will be updated as soon as it becomes available.

For further information, please do not hesitate to contact Gisela Galicia at 
(41 22) 869 1450 or mailto:mexicomeeting@weforum.org
(  ) Please send me more information on the conditions for participation.

In regard to your request for Ken to chair a Forum segment and join the

Hello Mr. Lay,

It's been a long time since we've talked.  I'm Priscilla Slade, President of
Texas Southern University.  The primary purpose of this e-mail is to invite
you to attend a weekend at the home of President and Mrs. Bush September
16-18.  So many people have expressed a desire to become know more about the
University (it's new initiatives and successes) that  President Bush
volunteered to host a gathering of 25 CEOs and spouses (or a second person
in the corporate hierarchy).  In addition to having fun golfing, sailing,
boating, etc., we are presenting ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT TEXAS SOUTHERN
UNIVERSITY.

I know this is your favorite topic and that we can look forward to you
joining us.  An invitation is in the mail.  I look forward to you joining
us.

Sincerely,

Priscilla



Ms. Peppers, I am very sorry, but I must once again reschedule the 
appointment that you have with Mr. Lay.  He will be out of town the entire 
week of September 26.  

The first available time to reschedule is October 19, 2000.  Would an 
afternoon appointment work for you - about 2:00 p.m.?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear Dean Walker -

Ken Lay asked me to respond to you re:  1). naming the new professorship the 
Pinkney C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship - this is fine.
2)  He will be pleased to serve as the keynote speaker for the banquet on 
October 13.

Thanks.

Subject: P. Walker professorship and keynote request


Thanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the
professorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted that you plan to
attend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.

The purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient
way of reaching you, is two-fold:

     1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney
C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the
professorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some
other area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in
the College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.
Both Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into
Harold Hook to seek his input.

A few points of elaboration:
     * "Distinguished" is a standard adjective in the titles of such
positions.
     * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the
college to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my
approval.
     * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October
13.

This name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength,
(2) allows me to avoid any "turf battles" (either within the college or with
Economics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the
college.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.

     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society
banquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief
talk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of
business.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive
event.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now
live in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have
chosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.
Your talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed
(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.
I understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the
morning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable
for the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in
choosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you
will serve as the keynote speaker.

If you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the
plans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney
Walker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if
you have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is
573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.

Let me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not
Pinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been
experiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that
he intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.
Time permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll
see him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his
wife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I
will host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.  Of
course, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it's
my understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)

Ken, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of "R&R"
during your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.


Ken Lay asked me to advise you that he can't do this one, but would consider 
other dates.

Ken, I understand that you are trying to clear your sch. to speak at the
River Oaks Breakfast Club on Oct. 26.  I hope it works out because I always
hear what is going on at Enron.  Peter

Mr. Hines -

To get back with you re: your question about some kind of Futures/Options 
market in the commercial space market, Ken Lay said that to approach Jeff 
Skilling about it is absolutely the right approach.

Subject: Arena


I wanted to make sure you were aware of something that has come up since
the last breakfast meeting regarding our group financing the Arena parking
garage.  Baker & Botts put us in touch with the Rockets to discuss Hines
being the Development Manager on the Arena and garage.  Although not fully
agreed, there is strong interest on both sides.  Besides help on the
development front, we think there may be value in our acting as a bit of a
buffer between the Sports Authority and the Rockets and coordinating any
issues involving the new convention hotel(where we are also providing
development management).  The Rockets(Mike Goldberg-Baker & Botts) have
talked to Ric Campo and supposedly he is enthusiastic but thinks this
should "be the Authority's idea.".  One issue is how much of our fee would
apply to the garage, which presumably the city would pick up, and how much
would apply to the Arena.  Since this is a fast moving issue, I wanted you
to know about this. Obviously the discussions are all very confidential.
If you have any thoughts in advance of the next breakfast meeting, please
give me a call at 713-966-2606.

Also, on another topic, we have been doing a tiny bit of pie in the sky
brainstorming on the concept of creating some kind of Futures/Options
market in the commercial space market.  I will approach Jeff Skilling
unless you would recommend elsewhere within Enron.



Hi Mr. Moore -

I did hear back from Mr. Lay.  Will September 11 at 3:00 p.m. work for you?

With regard to working out a convenient date to meet with  you, Rosalee has

either September 11 or 13 work? After that I have to join Norm  Blake at the 
Olympics in Sydney. While all of this can de done by phone, as  deputy to the 
chairmen, I'm making every effort to meet (albeit briefly) with  each 
Committee member. If you are willing to host a meeting in Houston, I want  to 
make every effort to have Paul Newman in  attendance.


Dar, are you on-line?  If so, please answer back.  I have questions.  Well, 
I'll ask them.  Did you get the wedding pics?

I seem to have three appointments next week:

Tuesday, August 29:  Doctor appointment at 9:40 a.m. (enlightenment)

Wednesday, August 30:  Hair appointment @ 2:00 p.m (beauty)

Thursday, August 31:  Dental appointment @ 2:00 p.m. (ouch)


I plan to return to the office each day, but the dental appointment may take

Subject: Governors Conference




Dear Ken, 

It was good to talk with you last week, and I hope you got some vacation in 
Aspen.? I'm working at it! 

Rosalie said you'd be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you 
by phone or e-mail before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you.? 
Governor Knowles (classmate of George W.), along with Governor Taft of Ohio, 
has enlisted us in a conference that seven governors are sponsoring on 
natural gas in order to elucidate the market and issues -- and needs -- 
before it explodes as a political issue -- and perhaps helps head it off (in 
contrast to what happened with gasoline).? Governor Knowles is the current 
chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be under the 
auspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and a lot of 
other distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very timely event.

They would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be kicking 
off the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high visibility 
platform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and honored -- to have 
you in that featured role in it works for your schedule.

It takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. 

Tony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms very 
large for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill you in 
further on what they would like to accomplish.

If it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, 
that would be great. 

On behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. 

Best, 

Dan 



Amy, you are a treasure!!!  I know you'll be a treasure of a Mom, too!!  But 
I'll miss you!!

Ken,

Sorry to miss you today when I called. Since I am leaving for India in a
few minutes, I thought I would sent you an E-mail, and then I can try to
call you from India. Because of the time difference, it will not be easy
for us to connect. Unfortunately I will not be back in the US until
December 7.

The reason for my call was to see if you would feel comfortable putting my
name forward to Dick Cheney for a position in the new administration. I am
not sure where the best fit would be, but it might be Chairman of the
National Economic Council. That job has a good combination of management
and economics. You know I have only been associated with Democratic
administrations in past, but Democratic administrations were a little
different in those days. You are somewhat familiar with my record on
economics and there is a lot on that in the public domain.

Just let me know what you think. Maybe a quick E-mail would suffice ( I am
carrying my computer).

Best regards,
Bill

Since all of you have been such great supporters of our efforts to raise

Hi Mr. Moore -

I'm sorry that we didn't discuss dates this morning as Mr. Lay is on vacation 
until September 5.  As that will be his first week back after being out for 
several weeks, it is already pretty booked up. 

I will certainly share this e-mail with him.  Is it possible to update Mr. 
Lay on the progress of the Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy by 
e-mail?  Another thought might be to see if our Executive Vice President of

28 or 29.  Ms. Olson is in charge of Enron's Community Relations Department.

Please advise.

The next World Economic Forum will be held September 11-13 in Melbourne.  I 
have received information from the Control Risks Group that several 
anti-capitalist and anarchist groups are planning major demonstrations to 
disrupt the proceedings. Like the earlier incidents in Seattle, large-scale 
clashes between demonstrators and police are expected.

If you or any of your staff members are planning to attend, you might want to 
consider your personal security when making hotel and local travel 
accomodations.  Corporate Security can provide local personal security agents 
if you desire.

Any non-essential travel to Melbourne during this time frame should be

Subject: Invitation to deliver 2001 IAEE conference keynote


Dear Ken:

Next April 25-27, 2001, Houston will host the 24th conference of the
International Association for Energy Economics, in combination with the
annual meeting of our U.S. Association for Energy Economics affiliate.  We
invite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon
on Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this
event.

Our theme is "2001: An Energy Odyssey." We are using the conference to
showcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to
deal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as
enterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to
clearly define these major themes and priorities than you.

I was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in
Montreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that
the regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t=
o
heart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the
opportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of
vital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include
comments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both
guiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in
markets on behalf of enterprises.

The IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business an=
d
university interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring yo=
u
up-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure
Rosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together
for you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc=
e
(at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In
addition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of
RD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues
and Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a
joint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology
Conference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas.

Finally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate
sponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project,
which you helped to found.  Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to hel=
p
identify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary
session, "Sustaining Development" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn
thinking around with our re-phrasing).

I hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.  We
look forward to having you with us next April!

Dear Mr. Galvan,

Thank you for your recent letter concerning my support of a new basketball=

arena in Downtown Houston.  I believe that the responsibilities of my=20
position at one of the world=01,s leading companies extend far beyond day t=

business- I take a leading role in the communities where my employees live=
=20
and work. =20

I agree that corporate stewardship is essential in our community. At Enron,=
=20
we are aware of the underserved populations in our neighborhoods, which is=
=20
why each year we give back one percent of our earnings to charitable causes=
.=20
As we have grown, so have these donations. Enron=01,s community investments=
=20
include supporting programs that promote cultural diversity, educational=20
programming and scholarships, and assisting those struggling to rebuild the=
ir=20

Three years ago, Houstonians took the initiative to keep the Houston Astros=
=20
in town by passing a baseball stadium referendum that sparked the=20
revitalization of our downtown district. A new downtown basketball arena to=
=20
house our hometown Houston Rockets and Comets would amplify our current=20
efforts.=20

Houston has a vibrant, attractive, central business district that is=20
recognized globally.  A basketball arena is of key importance for the=20
continuing revitalization of downtown Houston, for keeping the Rockets and=
=20
Comets in town, and for retaining an exceptional workforce in our world cla=
ss=20
city. We must not allow our city to lose its competitive advantage on or of=
f=20
the court.=20

Enron has more than 6,500 employees who work and live in Houston and we all=
=20
take great pride in this city and its success.  We plan to stay in Houston=
=20
for a long time, and it is essential that the Houston Rockets and Comets ma=
ke=20
Houston their home, too. Downtown now has a new feeling and a new level of=
=20
excitement and Houston cannot afford to stop the momentum.

Sincerely,

Ken Lay

Michael, I think Monday will be fine.

Hi Kenny: Bonny sent me your E-mail address and
so I am trying it out. Sorry we could not make it
to the party. The temperature is very warm here
in Kansas today. I checked Enron stock recently
and it looks like it is doing fine. I am
particularly interested in your venture into the
fiber optics communications business and the
windpower. We sold our interest in the Cellular
business last year and I think the land line
company will be sold soon. We sold to Allied
Telephone Coimpany of Little Rock. Two other
engineers and myself put Kansas Cellular together
about 14 years ago. Then we built a fiber system
from East to West across Kansas. That was sold
with the Cellular. Take care of yourself-Loyal

Subject: Dinner with V. Fox

Dear Ken,
 Federico Sada, who is travelling with President elect Vicente Fox in South 
America, called me this morning, 
and asked me to give you the confirmed list of attendees to the dinner in New 
York, Wednesday August 23, 8:00 P.M.
at the Watteau Room of the St. Regis Hotel:

 Sanford I. Weill   Citigroup, Inc.   Chairman and CEO
 Hendrick Verfaille  Monsanto Co.   President and CEO
 William B Harrison, Jr.  Chase Manhattan Corp.  Chairman and CEO
 Raymond V. Gilmartin  Merck and Company, Inc. Chairman and CEO
 Michael Armstrong  AT&T    Chairman and CEO
 Stephen M. Wolf  US Airways   Chairman and CEO
 Kenneth L. Lay   Enron Corp.   Chairman and CEO

Pending confirmation
 Douglas A. Warner III  J.P. Morgan   Chairman

According to Federico, if there is any late cancellation, no one will be 
substituted. Also, there is a small possibility that
the dinner could take place in Washington, rather than N.Y., based on Fox's 
meeting with President Clinton; they are still
working on the final agenda. 
 
 Max and myself are working on the background information that you will need, 
and will keep you posted of any 
changes; best regards,  jaime____

Mr. Christman:

Thank you for your invitation for Dr. Lay to speak at your upcoming forum in

If you are inclined to accept this invitation, we could put together an 
interesting talk on the importance of good mental health to business with 
some national statistics and then segue into Enron's emphasis on wellness and 
having fun in the workplace.  Our strategy and experience will be very 
interesting to the group since it shows what a corporate leader is doing to 
become the employer of choice in the marketplace.

You could expect a full house (around 400) for the talk.  If it fits into 
your schedule, Jack Bowen said he would be delighted to be honorary chairman 
of the event.

Letter dictated by Ken Lay

Gene:

 I appreciated the update on your health status.  It appears you are taking a 
very tough situation and, with help from some of the best doctors in the 
world, setting about to turn it around.  I'm sure it goes without saying that 
you know we are all pulling for you and betting on a positive outcome.

 Clearly your health is the number one issue now.  To the extent you want to 
work and can work, we are delighted to have you back in the office.  But that 
is a very distant secondary concern until you get everything done about your 
health that can be done.  If there is any way I or Enron can be of any 
further help, please let me know.

Ken 
Dictated letter from Ken Lay

Dear John:

I enjoyed your recent e-mail.  I also appreciate your kind comments 
concerning our broadband activity.  The deal with Blockbuster has been a 
great deal of fun and is opening up all kinds of additional opportunities.

I enjoyed looking through the agenda for your meeting in Sweden.  It looks 
quite informative and interesting.  Sweden is also an excellent place for a 
summer conference.

The young man you refer to in your letter should send his resume to Celeste 
Roberts at (713) 853-0555.  If he would also copy me on the letter to 
Celeste, I would be happy to follow up and make sure it is carefully 
considered.

I'm delighted that your life appears to be going very well at the current 
time.  I hope our paths will again cross in Aspen or elsewhere in the not too 
distant future.

Warm regards,

Ken

Ken-I have revised the term sheet provided to us by George yesterday along
the lines that you suggested to give the partners somewhat stronger rights
on the choice of seats and suites.  These rights are not as strong as the
rights the Partnership got from the Astros, but I hope they will be
considered sufficient by the partners.  I received an e-mail yesterday from
Conoco reiterating Archie's concern on the preferential rights.  So far, all
of the partners  I've heard from on the financing term sheet are OK with it.
However, I haven't yet heard from Ric Campo on the financing term sheet.

Dear Mr. Lay:

winning side last year, and I am galvanizing to be be on the winning side
this year.
I find it very deporable that the Sports Authority cancelled its Board
Meeting tomorrow. This is another dirty trick that the Sports Authority is
making to make it harder for citizens to voice their opinions. This is one
more reason for taxpayers to vote no for any taxpayer funds to fund a new
arena that is not needed.

Hi Deborah -

Ken Lay does want to meet with you re:  your earlier e-mail.  I know this 
sounds incredible, but the really best date is not until September 26!!!  His 
schedule is just not to be believed!!!  He is pretty free that day, so he 
could do an early afternoon.  Would 2:00 p.m. work for you?

Thanks.

Subject: 2nd Annual Enron/MDA Beach Bowl


Hello, Mr. Lay! Enron and MDA are joining together again to do a 2nd Annual 
Beach Bowl to raise money for MDA. Last year, the event was a great success, 
raising over $70,000.  This year's goal is to raise $100,000, so the 
fundraising benchmarks for all teams have been raised. The money raised will 
be used to further research for ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).

I have put together a team of Analyst interns (Howard Goldfarb, Rachel 
McPhaul, Nicole Brady, Bradley Aiken and myself) for a second year to help in 
this cause.  The benchmark for the team is the raise $600 (pre-matching), but 
I want to outdo the fundraising of $1400+ (post-matching) we did last year.

I am asking for a donation to MDA to help our team bowl in this event.  
Checks are payable to MDA.

FYI, Enron matches all donations $20 or more. 

The event will take place on Saturday, July 29, 2000.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks! Have a great day!

Dear Kenneth,

 Hello! I wanted to inform you of an exclusive Delphi Event.  Attached is a 
letter from Tom Koulopoulos, The Delphi Group's CEO, explaining the details 
for our upcoming Executive Retreat to be held on August 28-29 in Aspen. This 
is going to be a truly unique experience.

 I would like to extend you and other senior level executives at Enron an 
invitation to this  event. I have already invited George Short. This event is 
limited attendance since the St. Regis Aspen can only accommodate 200. The 
early registration fee is $2500.00 per seat.

 I will follow up with you later in the week. In the meantime, if you have 
any questions, please e-mail or call me at 617-247-1511.

Best Regards,

Shawn Christy

Dear Mr. Lay,

As you are no doubt aware your colleague Jeffrey Skilling  recently made a=

success of that event, I would like to invite you to make the  keynote=20
address at Energy & Power Risk Management  Conferences=01, third annual=20
information technology event as  outlined above. This year's keynote sessio=
n=20
is entitled "The E-Commerce Revolution: Innovations and  opportunity in the=
=20
electronic energy marketplace". This session has no  bullet points as I wou=
ld=20
like the speaker to address only the latest issues as  they see fit. My=20
research has showed that the industry is very interested in  your opinions =
on=20
this subject and I hope you can fit this hour-long session into  you busy=
=20
schedule.

=01+Information Technology=01, will take a focused look  at the latest adva=
nces=20
being made in the energy market=01,s systems and  technologies. The confere=
nce=20
will be structured in two streams, offering  delegates and speakers the=20
chance to tailor the event to their own areas of  interest. The streams wil=
l=20
be partitioned into five areas:=20

1) Information technology for risk management

2) Information technology for pricing and trading

3) Data techniques and strategies

4) Advanced technologies for trading and risk management

5) Challenges of the evolving energy marketplace

Each of these categories will investigate the kind of problems  being faced=
=20
by energy IT/IS managers, traders and risk managers alike. I have  attached=
 a=20
copy of the program for your information. There will also be a  software=20
exhibition at the conference at which vendors will be demonstrating  their=
=20
products, as well as a post-conference seminar on data management.

This conference will be of the highly technical level that  people have com=
e=20
to expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage  participation=
=20
from speakers in modifying the program to suit the audience and  issues at=
=20
hand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please  let=
=20
me know; any help would be gratefully received.

This event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy  & Power Risk=20
Management Magazine and our extensive database. It is my aim to  attract th=
e=20
leading market players by providing a first-class program with  top-rated=
=20
speakers, making this a highly worthwhile event for the energy  industry.

Unfortunately my schedule for this program is very tight. I  would greatly=
=20
appreciate an email soon to let me know if you would like to take  part in=

this event. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to  ge=

Dear Rosalie/Dorothy:

Tomorrow, we are sending to all participants via Airbourne, reading

We have noticed that our mailing address for Mr. Lay is a p.o. box.
Unfortunately, our express courier will not ship to a p.o. box.  Is there a

him his Dialogue materials?

Your assistance in this would be greatly appreciated.
