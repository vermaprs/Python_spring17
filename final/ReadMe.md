For Final Project, I am using NYTimes Archive API. I have downloaded the dataset for last 5 years.

Analysis 1 - I am counting 'Trump','Obama', 'Hilary' words in the dataset for last 5 years. This analysis shows that The word 
'Trump's' count had a significant percentage uncrease in the year 2016, while it reduced for Hilary and Obama in comparison
 to last 5 years. Then, I saved the output in csv file, loaded it as Data frame. Then plotted the graph using dataframe using 
seaborn.

Analysis 3 - I am counting all words in the headline on monthly basis for last 5 years. This analysis shows how the total number 
of headlines varies over the last five years. Then, I saved the output in csv file, loaded it as Data frame. Then plotted the graph using dataframe using
